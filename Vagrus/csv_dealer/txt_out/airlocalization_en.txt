Aristocrat
You were born into nobility and still retain some of its advantages.
Human (Tarkian)
A land of vast deserts, arid mountains, and tranquil oases, Tark has long been a problematic yet prosperous province of the Empire. Its people, the Tarkians are a divided lot - city dwellers typically support Imperial rule, having adapted to a profitable symbiosis, while most desert tribes detest what they see as an occupation force. Tarkian culture is exotic to Imperial eyes, and its many unique products have permeated the Empire throughout the centuries but this is not true the other way round. Originating from desert nomads, Tarkians are great at navigating and surviving arid wastelands and are all said to be merchants at heart. Sometimes this means they have a suspicious or unsavory reputation elsewhere.\n\nTarkians have dusky skin and dark hair.
Freeplay
No victory condition. You can play freely for as long as you desire.\n\n/You can only win the game if you change your Ambition later through options in a story. If you do so, you will still have to achieve that goal no later than 10 in-game years after the game's start./
Human (Dajmahan)
Dajmaha, the Land of Endless Rain occupies the northeastern peninsula of the continent of Xeryn, cut off from most other regions by vast mountain ranges and dense jungles. Its people, the Dajmahans, are the descendants of ancient Zenrak, having lived mostly in fractured tribal communities since that old empire’s fall. Dajmaha was miraculously spared from the Calamity, yet magical anomalies and mutants did enter its boundaries afterwards. Several centuries ago, a clan of Dajmahan sorceresses rose to rule the land from three city states on the coast. The Empire has made several attempts to colonize Dajmaha but it has proved impossible as of yet. Dajmahans are often athletic and possess incredible stamina but are considered savages by others.\n\nDajmahans are dark skinned and dark haired.
Orc
Having been summoned as roaming souls from the Outer Realms and given bodies in a ritual of unmatched sorcerous power, Orcs were created as the perfect warriors without memories: weapons of the Empire in their war on the northern continent about 350 years before present day. However, the Orcs soon found out about the deceit of their masters and rebelled against them. Following a brutal war that nearly collapsed the Empire and made Orcs nigh-extinct, a tenuous status quo was reached in the end, and the surviving Orcs relocated to the swamplands of Darkmoor at the edge of the Empire. Living in tribal societies there ever since, Orcs have become a thorn in the side of everyone, raiding, marauding, and engaging in piracy ceaselessly. Their spirit faith is propagated by shamans and meshes surprisingly well with Orcish warrior culture. Many Orcs find work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and gladiators throughout the Empire, though fear and suspicion surrounds them.\n\nOrcs are muscular, athletic, sturdy, and possess amazing stamina. They are human-sized, with black hair and skin that ranges in color from green to brownish.
Veteran
You used to serve in a military force, fighting for a cause or for coin.
Savage
You lived in a tribal society and know how to survive in the wilderness.
Trader
You are a traveling merchant, a nomadic trader interested in transporting goods, news, and people to the faraway reaches of the Empire for profit.
Half-Elf
Not all Dor Anthelas Elves took their own lives after the Calamity or became embittered to the point of insanity. Some of them wandered out into the world and lived out their remaining years among the mortals who survived. These Elves mingled with humans and their progeny are known as the Pereldin, the Half-Elves. Most of them retain the pointed ears, magnificent sight, and light-footedness of their Elven parent as well as the adaptability of their human one. They do not have a culture or realm of their own and typically live their lives on the road or among other folk. Most Gwaeth Elves consider them abominations and most humans think of them as Elves, treacherous and furtive, so they do not trust them.\n\nHalf-Elves are tall and lean, with a mostly Elvish appearance yet also some human traits.
Mercenary
You are the captain of a mercenary company that seeks to work dangerous jobs, hunt bounties, or even raid camps and settlements out in the wasteland.\n\n/This Calling is geared towards armed conflicts and starts with a larger fighting crew, which results in higher upkeep. Therefore, we only recommend choosing Mercenary for more experienced players./
Entertainer
You used to make a living entertaining people.
Healer
You studied and practiced the art of healing.
Criminal - Loaders
Your past involved criminal activities and you still have connections to the Loaders' Guild.
Dwarf
The mighty Dwarven kingdom of Dvendar Tharr was the greatest ally of the Empire before the Calamity, and gifted humans most secrets of metal and stone. Dwarven technology was a true marvel, and the line of Inventor Kings governed the kingdom into a golden age of progress. When the Calamity struck, most of Dvendar Tharr was cursed and destroyed in a conflagration of fire and lava as the great mountains that they were built upon and into erupted. The several thousand survivors of the cataclysm became a wandering people, at the same time coveting and hating the technology that they think led to their downfall. Their former merry and progressive nature turned into bitterness, pragmatism, and cynicism. For all intents and purposes, Dwarves are a dying race.\n\nStocky and sturdy, Dwarves are a hardy folk. Men almost always grow beards.
Criminal - Carpenters
Your past involved criminal activities and you still have connections to the Carpenters' Guild.
Renown
Your goal is to become well-known and respected in society, one of the most famous /vagri/ ever to travel the far reaches of the Empire.\n\n/Choose this Ambition if you want to focus more on completing difficult quests and working towards unlocking a higher standing for a number of Factions. Continuously securing funds to be able to do these is still required. You have around 10 in-game years to complete this goal./
Explorer
You are a seeker of knowledge and new places, someone who delves into ancient ruins and dangerous locations to find treasures, artifacts, and old secrets.\n\n/This Calling is geared towards surviving in the wilderness and starts with a larger specialized crew, which results in higher upkeep. Therefore, we only recommend choosing Explorer for more experienced players./
Adventurer
You used to travel a lot and sought adventure everywhere.
Slaver
You were a professional slave catcher and slave trader.
Artisan
You used to craft goods and sell them for a living.
Ranger
You learned how to live and survive in the wastelands of the continent.
Human (Kalani)
The Kalani people of the east originate from coastal clans who survived the fall of Kimora. Their progressive and wealthy realm joined the Empire in the Golden Age and contributed considerably to the rise of Imperial society and culture. The Calamity struck and vastly changed the face of the eastern regions, erasing Kalani cities and burning the wonderful forests into formations of glass and crystal. The people survived as three separate clans and rejoined the Empire when it reemerged. Crystal is everywhere in Sargot Kala, the richest and most important of the three regions, so crystal harvesting, crystal growing, and Crystalmancy has become the major occupation in the region. Kalani are considered good mediators and a stoic, strong-willed people.\n\nKalani are usually dark haired and fair skinned with blue or green eyes.
Demonkin
Demonkin is a general name for the many beings that have Demonic blood in their veins but it is more specifically used for those who have Demonic ancestry in their grandparents or farther back. The heritage manifests as an aura of uneasiness that surrounds the Demonkin, as well as in physical - and sometimes sorcerous - traits borne by the person. Each type of Demon produces a set of traits in its Demonkin typical to its own form and abilities. Demonkin came to be fairly common on the continent after the Calamity, as the cataclysm broke the barriers between the Outer Realms and Xeryn, allowing denizens of the Abyss to enter and thrive in the Riven Realms, and to mingle with its mortal inhabitants. Demonkin do not have a culture or realm of their own but live among other races, most frequently humans.\n\nDemonkin look fairly human but retain some physical aspects of their Outer Realms ancestors - most commonly horns, fangs, claws, as well as unusual skin and eye color.
Priest - Imperial
You used to study and practice Imperial religious dogma.
Scholar
You studied a great many subjects and are considered wise.
Wealth
Your goal is to amass a great amount of wealth so that you don’t have to worry about the future ever again.\n\n/Choose this Ambition if you want to focus on trading, resource management, and the economy aspects of the game without having to get into quests and stories. You have around 10 in-game years to complete this goal./
Knowledge
Your goal is to learn everything there is to learn about the continent and its inhabitants, as well as to find a way to preserve it for posterity.\n\n/Choose this Ambition if you want to focus on hunting for obscure Codex entries as well as delving into dangerous locations. Continuously securing funds to be able to do these is still required. You have around 10 in-game years to complete this goal./
Dark Elf
According to legend, the race today called Moreldin were once Elves, but their ancestors were cast out and exiled after massacring their own kind during a series of tragic events. Shunned and stripped of their immortality, this progenitor clan sought refuge underground and found solace in the perpetual darkness and the embrace of Demonic worship. They hate light and the sun that burned their eyes and revealed them for what they truly were. In the next several thousand years, they conquered the deep places, built their underground great cities, and became a power to be reckoned with. After the Calamity, many of them relocated below Xeryn from their northern realms as it seemed to be both a new frontier and a place that became more hospitable to their needs. Loosely allied with the Empire, many Dark Elves are known to worship Demons, among whom Bal Ur Kaal is chief.\n\nDark Elves look like Elves, but are shorter, with dark grey skin and pale blue eyes. Their hair is white, grey, or silver.
Sorcerer's Apprentice
You used to study sorcery briefly and still retain some knowledge of it.
Human (Imperial)
Imperials are an industrious and generally cultured people, tracing their origins back to the ancient humans of Daromar who migrated south and settled in the land of Aetruas. The Empire managed to survive the Calamity, albeit at great cost, and remains one of the greatest powers on the continent of Xeryn. At its peak, few - if any - realms could match its prosperity, knowledge, and power, though this came at the cost of slavery and the oppression of other nations. Imperials in the Fourth Age are usually proud of such a past, though it is sometimes fused with a sense of bitterness. Business and progress are also close to the Imperial spirit and the heritage of building a great society still lingers in the post-Calamity era.\n\nImperials are light of skin and often dark of hair, though people of Daromarian heritage tend to be tall and fair haired.
Laborer
You used to be a manual worker or a slave.

Criftaa
A merciless bounty hunter and slave catcher, Criftaa has earned herself a dreadful reputation in recent years. Her dark past is full of violence and surviving what she had made her a very tough customer. That history makes her distrustful and sometimes even cruel. Criftaa is Tainted and although the transformation clearly took a great toll on her mind, it gave her amazing sight and reflexes in turn. She is an excellent shot with the bow and an accomplished huntress on top of that. Whether the target is a beast or a person, Criftaa has little to no qualms and rarely misses her mark.
Renkailon
Renkailon is a Dark Elf and thus is not a common sight in the sun-drenched northern reaches of the Empire as his kind shuns the light in general. However, through his long life as a wanderer, explorer, and scout-for-hire, Ren has learned how to deal with such inconveniences — and much more. He is a capable fellow, even if somewhat of a coward, preferring to skulk in the background and deal with matters in a subtle way. A veteran of many /comitati/, he has a vast amount of experience coordinating scouts and leading the way. Renkailon is fairly likable and easy-going — for a Dark Elf — but he seems to be harried by something he does not want to disclose.

Gor’Goro is considered a prodigy among Orcs, especially when his relative youth is taken into account. A warrior of great renown — former gladiator, feared marauder, and drill master — he has already seen more combat than most other fighters do in a lifetime. Yet for some reason, Gor’Goro has not stepped up as a Warleader for his own kin and chose to wander the continent, living as a mercenary instead, unsure about the fate marked out for his people as well as for his own person. Lately a trainer of gladiators and warriors, the young Orc is eager to set out again and explore the continent. With his skills and experience, he can become a great asset to any /comitatus/.

Vorax means “gluttonous” in the Imperial tongue, a name this Undead earned because he keeps devouring food even though his dead innards can no longer digest it. This is something of a mystery rivaling only his reason for returning from the echoing halls of Tartaris. Garrulous and jovial, Vorax recalls nothing from his former life except for his cooking skills. That — coupled with his obsession with food, as well as his exceptionally sharp mind — makes him a great quartermaster. He seems to be solely interested in campfire stories and good eating but some believe that terrible secrets are hiding beneath all that geniality. Vorax pays little mind to them, however, only wishing to please.

Eylani
The free-spirited beastmaster has wandered the wastelands of terra supra for decades now, living off of hunting. She enters the employment of /vagri/ or other influential people from time to time, but when the notorious wanderlust of Half-Elves overtakes her, she is known to leave and walk her path alone. Rumor has it that she sometimes shares these journeys with someone close to her. Eylani is a skilled warrior, scout, huntress, and tracker, but her greatest asset is her unique ability to communicate with animals, which makes her one of the best beast handlers in the Realms. Just be careful not to hurt animals unless absolutely necessary, as that is something she cannot abide.

Skornar
The former kingpin and veteran warrior Skornar, called “The Blue-faced”, does not hail from Xeryn but from the green continent in the north. Generally, this would mean capture and persecution, yet the fierce marauder not only avoided this fate but managed to build a life and business for himself in the Riven Realms. Fearless and clever, he was respected by all, but even still, ambitious young blood saw the time to remove the aging mob boss eventually. Skornar is not someone to be easily disposed of, however, and having survived the ordeal, he is eager to pay treachery back in kind. Many would underestimate him due to his age but he still wields his shield and axe with deadly proficiency.

Ever since she was a child, she has been told that she is destined for greatness, which perfectly explains her sense of entitlement and self-righteousness. Yet when presented with opportunities at the Hall of Voices on a silver platter, she rather chose the dangerous position of diplomatic attaché to foreign lands, wishing to prove that she can do well without her family’s influence. As a pureblood Dragonmage, she can wreak havoc using lightning-based magic and protect the /comitatus/ from arcane threats. Finndurarth is educated in a number of scholarly topics as well, and her charisma is undeniable.

Harvek
The sinister-looking Harvek is a true survivor and a warrior for hire with strong connections to organized crime. After getting involved with /collegia/ at a young age, he was eventually arrested and taken to Purgatoria, considered to be the cruelest prison on the continent. Inmates do not usually make it to their one year anniversary there but Harvek survived for twelve whole years, largely thanks to his transformation due to the Taint, which gave him mutations he learned to use as lethal tools. He was eventually released and now started looking for work. Harvek is usually calm and professional, yet he has something menacing about him, a cruelty that comes natural to the Tainted mercenary.

Nedir
Nedir used to study in the Crimson Order, the continent’s most powerful and influential covenant of mages. However, her curiosity regarding the darker arts and her no-nonsense attitude led to her leaving the Order, and she ended up wandering the Realms. Yet, this has not quenched her thirst for magical knowledge and Nedir taught herself a lot in the past years, becoming adept at forms of pyromancy, blood magic, mind-altering spells, and even the summoning of Demonic beings. Her confidence and sharpness of mind has made her a formidable individual but there is a darkness in her, feeding on ambition and arrogance, as likely to damn the sorceress as it is to propel her to greatness.

Garrik
The Dwarf called Garrik is well-known in the criminal underworld of the central regions. His reputation as a nasty, mean, and malevolent creature is well-deserved, though these traits are generally attributed to Dwarves anyway. Garrik is disinterested in delving into the ruins of his fallen nation — he has built himself a smuggling business instead, which has seen him grow wealthy and influential. That is, until he lost everything due to some ill-fated ventures and loans. Garrik is not one to give up easily though, something perhaps stemming from Dwarvish stubbornness. He is an accomplished businessman and he always has something up his sleeve when it comes to fights.

An anointed knight of the Order of the Black Sun, Sedarias is a formidable man of noble birth in his early thirties. He is arrogant and self-absorbed, which no doubt stems from both an upbringing in privilege and the rigorous training he endured as a squire of the Order. In his eyes, this schooling has made him impeccable when pursuing retribution, something he does not take lightly. Wearing the signature black iron armor of his knightly order and wielding a greatsword as well as the unholy powers of his Gods, he is a force to be reckoned with. You saved his life, yet you’ve been press-ganged into helping him ever since.

He quickly earned your trust thanks to his good nature, his easy-going attitude as well as to his sorcerous abilities that involve scanning surface thoughts, dominating the minds of beasts, and even seeing glimpses of the near future. Javek is of Tarkian origin, and though he seldom speaks of this past, you have learned that he used to be a slave before he was liberated by a /vagrus/. His skills - both mundane and arcane - have proved to be invaluable to you in years past.

Due to a reputation of being a heartless mercenary and a loner, nobody considered Morwen a valuable asset to a /comitatus/ such as yours. Yet you saw something in her and offered her a job years ago. She accepted and you have never regretted it ever since. A deft scout and a skillful warrior, she has proven her mettle more times than you could recall. She is very quiet and reticent, which is in stark contrast with the aura of uneasiness that surrounds members of her race, the Demonkin. You don’t mind that either though, as she mostly keeps to herself.

Imperial Comitatus (2)
Carpenters' Guild
The Carpenters' Guild is one of the most powerful criminal syndicates of the Empire, growing rich on all kinds of illegal activities. They trace their history to craftsmen's unions in a long lost age when people knew what a carpenter truly was. Members like to think of themselves as highbrow entrepreneurs.
Abolitionists
A secret organization sworn to put an end to slavery in the Empire, the Abolitionist movement has been around since way before the Calamity and is responsible for many slave revolts throughout the long centuries of the Fourth Age. Far from united, they operate in cells often without contact to other similar coteries.

Ratharnak Alliance
A merchant charter born of the cooperation between the Green and Bronze Dragonlords, the Ratharnak are ruthless businessmen dealing in rare metals and clandestine plots in and outside of the Dragonlands. Many consider their cunning and aggressive ploys outright illicit but the Alliance has thus far avoided repercussions.
Cadmador
Although Cadmador is officially a Trading House, its clandestine activities in other countries along with its militaristic structure reveal them for what they are: ruthless agents of the Black Dragonlord's will.

An Imperial Trading House, Darius was born of a single renowned family's mariner legacy and is now among the most powerful trade unions in the Realms. It has monopolies on military supplies and is the largest player in the slave trade in the Fourth Age, which earned them an unsavory reputation.

The Church of Ahskul
Ahskul is the God of Death, and his Church is the largest of the Triumvirate, the Empire's official religion. Ahskulites look after the dead and hunt down the Undead — at least the ones unsanctioned by them. Most Necromancers have to live by the Ahskulites’ law when it comes to their morbid craft.

Founded half a century ago, the Imperial Trading House Oquo is considered an upstart by many but has proven to be just as powerful and ruthless as similar trade unions and organizations are. They have monopolies on obsidian and ivory, and their business keeps growing rapidly — to the horror of their competitors.
The Church of Sergorod
Devoted servants of Sergorod, God of Vengeance, Curses, and Anger, the Church is one of the most powerful religious institutions of the Empire and a cornerstone of the official Imperial cult. Judge, jury, and often executioner, priests of the Raging One wield terrifying power in the Realms.

One of the large criminal organizations of the Imperial underworld, the Guild grew out of the unionization of hoarders and loaders. Today, it is a shadowy gang that runs crime in big cities, especially smuggling, racketeering, and prostitution. They are considered lowly thugs by most.
Imperial Army (2)
Scythichnis Covenant
A merchant guild founded on the alliance of the Blue and Opal Dragonlords, the Scythichnis are often more interested in acquiring magical objects and knowledge than in trading goods and resources, considering themselves seekers and loremasters. Their hold on precious stones, crystals, and rare minerals still makes them filthy rich, of course.

House Venari is an old institution uniting merchants and rich aristocrats into a real economic powerhouse of the Empire. They have monopolies on oil and mushrooms but they are very prominent in other businesses as well — and their hold on mercenary companies is quite alarming to the other Houses.

Although Imperials mine their salt using slave labor at the Auguros Work Camp, merchants seem to know that the Scythichnis Covenant sells salt mining licenses in Salum to anyone who can afford it. Sure, it might be poisonous and back-breaking work, but there is a profit to be had for a well-equipped workforce.
It is for sale if you are interested in mining.
The warlike Utvorar are holed up on a volcanic shelf. The talk there is that the Fire Spirit loves to burn wood but the shamans can rarely get any. They also have no arable land, so grain fetches a good price here, too.
Utvorar is looking for things to burn and eat.
Word on the street is that one can find a nice jewelry shop in the Shadow Bazaar of Deven whose proprietor is selling rarities and curios as well. Now you know where to find it.
It is somewhere in Deven.
The rumor about a sickness that plagues the town's many salt miners circulates in Salum. Those falling ill feel a weakness get hold of them, then soon start to vomit. There are whispers of miners dying. Whatever it is, they seem to have contracted it outside of town.
It affects salt miners.
Kernak Waystation is abuzz with traders who now have a lot of unsold merchandise on their hands due to the blockade down south. They say that wine might fetch an especially good price up north.
Might this be an opportunity in disguise?
Everyone worth their salt knows that the town of Ash has long been converted into a slave trading outpost run mostly by House Darius and independent slavers. Now you know, too. The slave stock is nigh-inexhaustible there and one can even look for specially trained slaves from the Darius Chapterhouse.
The largest one in the region.
Some people talk enviously, others with outright hostility when it comes to the luxurious sky villas of the nobility of the Shelter. A crew of masons lets you know that at least it gives them work enough to feed their families. However, not enough shipments from the marble from Arken arrive these days for them to stay on schedule.
The poor struggle, the rich build more villas.
Rumors circulate that obsidian and metal are much in demand in the city of Deven due to its distance from regions where these resources can be obtained. Perhaps you could make good profit by taking advantage of this?
Sought after in the north.
Travelers you talk to at a tavern show you intricate crystal items they bought from a master Crystalmancer in Lumen. She buys and sells all manner of magic items, too.
She is said to dwell near crystals.
You overhear people talking about a Kal-rish fellow who is taking commissions for equipment for /comitati/. Apparently, the craftsman settled down in Crystal, something quite curious for his kind so touched by wanderlust.
He dwells in a nearby town.

A mysterious artisan has a shop somewhere.
The locals tell you that one of their hunting parties went north and never came back. Death is not uncommon in these parts yet a whole group of hunters disappearing is more than worrisome. They were supposed to return several days ago from the area to the north of Utvorar, near Flametear Lake.
Something made them disappear.
A lean fellow with dirt on his cheek complains about the increasing price of wine in the Shelter while it's being flooded with cheap mushroom beer. He clearly preferred the former.
Wine or Mushroom Beer?
Some vagabonds claim to have seen pale giants roaming the forgotten reaches of the Forsaken Colony. Some also told others who told you that they even talked to these creatures and traded goods. Perhaps it is all hogwash but who knows? Something could be out there.
What kind of beings are they?
According to locals, there's a fairly hidden trading post out in the Flats about two days almost due southeast of Avernum, run by some #Trading House. There might be a business opportunity there, though a lone wanderer claims that they have some trouble brewing at the outpost.
Is there something to be had?
There's talk of a bunch of bounties put out by the Avernum's administrators on targets ranging from wild beasts to runaway gladiators. You should visit the Slagfort if you want to earn some coin working as a bounty hunter. The bounty office there will have all the information you need.
Why are there so many?

They smuggle goods from Velarias.
The talk is that the Loaders' Guild has taken a notorious Dwarven smuggler prisoner for owing them a small fortune. Perhaps someone could buy him out at the bathhouse in Tor'Zag's Shelter, provided they are on good terms with the /collegium/.
Can someone get him out of it?
Ever since that strange earthquake and sudden gale - the one that left people with headaches and strange dreams for weeks - the winds have been more severe out in the wasteland. People have seen legionnaires marching south and claim they went to the Singing Winds.
It whispers strange words.
An elderly tracker has just returned to Urvorar from a trip to the desert and reputedly came across something interesting.\n\n'It is a large cave I used to rest in when I'm out among the dunes.' he says after you buy him a drink. 'But now some cursed strangers made camp in it and chased me away. Runaways or renegades, most like. If you want to find them, journey southeast from here for two days, then turn south between the quicksand fields.'
Who dwells in it?
Word is that a /lanista/ and gladiator teacher called Drius has gotten himself into a lot of trouble with the powers to be and now has to fight a gladiator match to clear his name. Yet very few in this city dare to side with someone despised by the high-ups. His compound can be found in the Market District.
Perhaps you could help them out?
There's talk of a horrid desert beast and a whole pack of smaller vermin that follows it around, attacking everyone they come upon in the arid wasteland. They are fairly cunning, setting ambushes and tracking prey. The pack was last seen about two days east of Vitrar.
It is on the hunt.
Apparently, a desperate bounty hunter went after Krog'Vor and his warband. She tracked the Orcs to Velarias and never came back. Perhaps you can pick up the pieces.

He is looking for a certain expertise.
According to visiting Kal-rish, an ancient, dying wanderer of their kin can be found in a small house near the Kal-rish market in Tor'Zag's Shelter. He might have something to sell you.
He might have something to offer.
An old vagabond was blathering about men in black armor sneaking around Terathion's Fall in the south from the Shelter. He may be seeing things due to cheap booze but maybe you could check it out?
Who could they be?
The talk of the town is that in the southern deserts, in the remotest regions, a new threat has emerged that is slowly but steadily making its way to the north. Witnesses claim that creatures writhing beneath the sands attack travelers and smaller settlements. Not even Tectum Carvos can escape this mysterious threat.
Abhorrent creatures roam the southern deserts.
People talk about savages living in two tribal settlements, one to the south, and another one further southwest of Avernum. These people worship the elements and their shamans are said to be able to heal the most terrible wounds. They are called the #Sadirar.
They are said to live nearby.
Word is that one could find a strange bookshop with an even stranger owner among the shacks and huts of Larnak's slums called the Fields. It reputedly sells rare and interesting books.
It sells rare tomes and volumes.
Word is that the Drusian Quarry on the northwestern edge of Sergorod's Blade produces copious amounts of obsidian that can be hauled east and north for a reliable profit.
The biggest obsidian quarry in the region.
The Mines of Plenty might be a prospecting station first and foremost but due to its position so close to the Dragonlands, it has taken on the role of a trade outpost as well. According to travelers, the Ratharnak Emporium can be found there, which might be interesting to anyone wishing to do business with the industrious Trading House.
The Ratharnak Alliance's headquarters.
There is talk about a strange block of warehouses in Avernum's Scoria district where people have gone missing. Some claim the place is haunted.
Citizens are fearful.

The dragons stir.
There is a man named Tullus Caepasius in Tor'Zag's Shelter who is looking to hire an independent /comitatus/. He can be found in the city's Temple District.
He is looking to hire /comitati/.
Apparently, there is a rich, underground mining site somewhere in the Northwestern Crag in the Hills of Plenty, ripe for the taking.
Promises yield and danger aplenty.
While potters do not have a lot of surplus after satisfying local demand in Tor'Zag's, one can export ceramic goods to other settlements fairly reliably. Vagri taking these wares to the crystal forests in the west and beyond speak of good profit.
The potters' guild is happy for once.
While Avernum is considered to be the main source of metal in the northern Empire with all the scrappers bringing their hauls to smelt in the city, in reality, most shipments of ore arrive at Tor'Zag's from the Mines of Plenty, controlled by the Dragonlords.
Avernum is just too far away.
Everyone seems to agree that Deven's mushroom beer is the best, especially considering its price. In fact, due to the endless fields where they grow the shrooms in that city, one can buy the beer as well as the raw crop itself at a really good value.
Mushrooms thrive there.
People gossip about a strange little shop in Sun Rock, cut into the rock face of a frequented plaza, run by an odd being. Nobody seems to agree on the creature's origin and looks, though. They say it sells curious goods and rare treasures.
It might be of interest to someone like you.
A dark rumor is abounding about the town of Salum. It states that the town's salt production is stunted compared to the presence of the Dragonlords' Trading Houses and therefore all of it is a charade to hide something. People in the know whisper that those speaking of this in Salum disappear quickly.
The town might not be what it seems.
The authorities are said to have closed off the pass in the Sepis Mountains guarded by the Twin Towers and do not let anyone through. The reason has something to do with the strange winds. People are furious, as they had to cut journeys short and turn back. It is bad for business, too.
They are turning everyone back.
With Deven being situated wholly underground, it comes as no surprise that people there require ways to produce light more than anywhere else. Brightkelp is said to be extremely sought-after for its ease to handle and persistent glow.
Sought after in dark places.
Asking the right people over at the market reveals that the tribe dwelling in an oasis in the south of Avernum values metal greatly - iron, copper, tin, silver, all exports of this city. Perhaps there is some profit to be made?
Avernum offers goods the Sadirar need.
The Sadirar hunters whisper about tracks out in the desert, leading to a camp among the endless dunes. It lies about two days southeast of Vitrar. The hunters warn you, however: there is a whole lot of tracks.
It's out there, in the desert.
Locals keep mentioning an odd Wraith called Vrak who is haunted by ghosts. At least that is what he claims, perhaps to justify his freakish behavior. But who knows, maybe you can help him out? They say he lives in the Hintercaves.
A Wraith runs amok.

Take our officials to a strategic location in contested territory, then, once their business is concluded, to %destination%. Our rivals may strike at any time during your journey.
A handful of slaves just snuck away from another comitatus. Their goal is to reach %destination% but on their own they will surely perish in the wasteland. Accompany them and help them get to their destination.
We obtained information about the location of a %opponent% hideout. Verifying this would be too much of a risk for us but you could figure it out and eliminate their agents.
Some mortal souls of the wasteland decided to set up their camp at a sacred burial site and that shall not stand. Push them out and defend the place long enough that they give up and leave.
A handful of our agents were captured by slavers - most likely those bastards do not even know that they caught Abolitionists. At any rate, find them and bust them out.
Despite our efforts to secure a mutually beneficial deal with an influential Imperial noble family, they now accuse us of trying to strongarm them. Bring them here so that we can clear this up in person.
Tainted crazies are trying to get into our site %location% and our defenses are faltering. We need you to hurry to our people’s aid and push the filthy horde back to where it belongs: the wasteland.
Our spies report that %opponent% set up a camp at a strategic point near our territory. We would pay a fair price to someone taking the location for us and holding it until relieved.
The competition seems to have let its guard down and the time for us to strike is at hand. We have a target for you in a contested region - it has to be held until our larger force relieves you.
Some doors remain shut to us, so we must influence certain people in high positions. We want you to abduct an Imperial officer’s closest family so that we can gain leverage with them.
Our scouts located a %opponent% lair but it is quite far from our territories. If you can massacre them, we would be able to move in and claim much coveted trophies and components.
We learned that %opponent% has a gap in their defenses at a faraway outpost. Use this knowledge to grab the people who work and live there so we can use them as bargaining chips.
The Empire placed some of our sympathizers under house arrest in a villa just recently. If you could free them, they would find it in their hearts to dedicate themselves wholly to our cause.
Take our magistrate to a strategic location in contested territory, then, once their business is concluded, to %destination% for debriefing. Expect resistance on the way.
Supporters of the Movement need to be taken to %destination% where they hope to shake the investigators of the Church. We believe that the inquisition will be on the hunt, so expect the worst.
A marauding Orc warband’s warriors might know about where other such raiders keep slipping into Imperial territory. We will need live captives to interrogate, of course.
We have identified a suitable site for our operations %location% but there are %opponent% swarming the area. Push them out and hold the position until we raise sufficient defences to keep them off.
A persistent pack of beasts are preying on our novices near a remote holy site where they are being trained by our priests. Since they do not have the means to get rid of them, you will have to.
Devoted supporters of %faction% need to reach an outpost %location%, then arrive at %destination%. You are to protect them on the way from anyone wanting to do them harm.
We have a frightened informant who is only willing to talk to agents he knows personally. For this reason, he has to be taken to our headquarters in %destination% where his old contacts work now.
%Opponent% had the gall to take our outpost and %faction% can not abide such conduct. You are to be our instrument in reclaiming what is ours. Make sure to stay until we can reinforce the site.
%Faction% has a clear stance on banditry, especially when our assets are becoming the targets of such vile actions. Go there and end these outlaws for us. Your reward will be most adequate.
An outlaw gang at the edge of our territory is impertinent enough to keep sacking one of our isolated bases. A show of force from your crew would surely take away their will to do it again.
Some followers of %opponent% possess knowledge of the whereabouts of a valuable artifact. You just need to bring them here, we will take care of the extracting of information.
The Empire often entrusts the organization of work camps to %faction%. One of the camps is constantly attacked by %opponent% who keep stealing slaves. This has to stop.
We need a distraction near an Imperial watchtower with a small garrison so that we can do a troublesome job. A decisive attack on it would be distracting enough.
We learned that a noble is trying to reanimate his children who died of plague. He hired outlaws to abduct some of our acolytes on a pilgrimage %location% before going to %destination%.
A Tainted mob overrun one of our outposts but a few of our people managed to escape. They saw others forced by the madmen to join them. Rescue them quickly. Who knows what they will do to them.
Something has been drawing Undead to a location on our territory. We must find out what is causing this but do not have the resources to remove them right now, so you will have to do it for us.
Our scouts found a site that could be an ideal hideout for the movement. Unfortunately, it is currently occupied by %opponent%. Clear out the place so that our people can claim the shelter.
A group of independent slavers has set its eyes on one of our tribal camps, assuming it will be easy prey. Go and show to them the error of their ways.
Our spies report that %opponent% set up a camp at a strategic point near our territory. We would pay a fair price to someone taking the location for us and holding it until relieved.
A group of slaves just broke free from an Imperial work camp. Although they are free, the whole wasteland now lies before them. Those poor souls are in dire need of someone to guide them to safety.
Imperials believe themselves untouchable. Here is where you come into the picture. We need you to bring a few individuals to us. They are reluctant to comply, so you will have to be very convincing.
A merchant has set up shop near one of our secret hideouts. He is not our enemy per se but there is a chance of him becoming aware of our dealings and we cannot risk him alerting the authorities.
Our spies report that %opponent% set up a camp at a strategic point near our territory. We would pay a fair price to someone taking the location for us and holding it until relieved.
Our acolytes heard a rumor that a former mentor of theirs who turned rogue will try to kidnap some of them during their journey to %destination%. We need your services to ease their minds as well as ours.
The neighboring %opponent% felt that our camp attracted too much attention from the Imperial authorities. They captured our tribe leaders and forced the rest of the camp to disperse. Hurry to their rescue, we need their experience to resettle soon. 
Escaped slaves turned marauders keep attacking our supply lines. While our enforcers are occupied elsewhere, it falls to you to put a stop to this audacity.

The Last Oasis
There is no way to say whether this large oasis is indeed the westermost one but the tiny outpost of sandstone huts and ragged tents at its heart is certainly the last place to grant any kind of comfort so far west from the cities of terra supra. Palm trees sway gently in the warm desert wind and in their shades, azure lakes stretch far and wide - a drop of green-blue in the endless yellow.
Jakarrokond
Lhouzm
Sundown Docks
Ahar Kadah
Dum Tordir
Fort Viridium
Saddling the cracked, blackened mountain peaks of Sergorod’s Blade, this Imperial fortress of dark stone and spiked battlements commands an awe-inspiring view of the surrounding bleak lands. For long centuries it has stalwartly guarded the region from the numerous enemies of the Empire. Scores of grim legionnaires occupy its vast barracks and great towers. It behooves you to watch your step here.
The Writhing Oasis
Once a tranquil glade of pristine lakes and billowing palm trees in a volcanic basin, the oasis transformed into a twisted, corrupted, noxious mass of plant life that moves in ways no flora should. No sane soul enters, as this place is death.
Dracis Bivaris
Mines of Plenty
The echo of falling pickaxes and back-breaking labour permeate the small mining settlement beneath the great cliffs that separate the Empire and the Dragonlands. Still, the distinct stench of reptiles is strong here, and the quarries, overseen by the Ratharnak Alliance and the Dragon Armies, supply the treasuries and furnaces of the Dragonlords. Such an abundance of ore in the metal-starved world is a lure few can resist.
Drusian Quarry
Prosperous beyond belief, the huge, terraced quarry at the tip of Sergorod’s Blade is the pride of House Oquo, whose bleak banner flies high on guard towers and administrative buildings alike while a veritable army of slaves and free workers toil day and night to get the best obsidian the region can offer, only for it to be fashioned into blades and spearheads for an army that keeps them in check.
Icaeron
Ras-Kal-Thep
The Glittering Pit
Vaelenesthil
Scrapheap
At the foot of the ever-fuming mountains of the ancient Dwarven kingdom lies Scrapheap, the town of scavengers. Debris and junk is piled into veritable hills, upon which the rickety homes of the decrepit inhabitants stand precariously. Ash lingers everywhere and the sun is almost always absent from the twilit skies. Deals are struck day and night over the precious metal scraps gathered in the ruins of nearby Dvendar Tharr while the Heap King oversees all from his dreaded tower. Shady eyes in soot-covered faces watch from under ash-laden awnings. Life is cheaper than iron here, some say.
Latros Work Camp
Blackwater
Fort Larius
The old fortress of Larius has stood at the center of these forsaken plains for many centuries - manned and vigilant until its tragic fall during the Orc Wars. It has been a hollow, wind-swept, weather-beaten ruin ever since, though not without the occasional raiders or liberated tribe to settle inside its crumbling walls and shattered battlements. Whoever sets up shop here must want to avoid attention from surrounding powers badly enough to move out to the middle of nowhere.
Tectum Carvos
They say that history repeats itself but they rarely say that it also has a cruel sense of irony. Both are true to Tectum Carvos, this frontier town built inside halls and tunnels dug into cliffs long ago by giant worm-like creatures - creatures whose descendants keep returning over and over again to snuff out all life here. And yet the settlers also come back to Tectum Carvos, as if trying to prove to the Gods that with enough willpower, mortals can thrive in even the most hostile of environments.
Demonsong Bridge
Necropolis Vox
Da Shorak
Deven
While the original site of Deven is nothing more than a stretch of rocky desert watched over by the silent, pitch-black columns of the Spires, the settlement did survive into the Fourth Age. The endless labyrinth of huge cavernous halls and twisting natural tunnels that encompass the city today have grown immensely since the Calamity. In the perpetual gloom of the subterranean chambers luminous crystals and brightkelp braziers grant enough light for businesses to thrive and citizens to build homes. That said, not all the inhabitants of Deven appreciate the light, as the disreputable Wraiths and other dwellers of darkness make up a large portion of the city’s population. It is best to keep looking over one’s shoulder lest a blade finds one’s heart.\n
Atergladium
Acherus Quarry
This gigantic basin at the foot of Sergorod’s Blade is a testament to what several centuries of cruel slave labor is capable of: they moved a mountain’s worth of rock and dirt to reach the precious obsidian underneath. Yet at length the black blood of the earth ran dry and only small amounts are mined these days. And so the quarry under the grim, dark cliffs and the overcast skies now looks even more desolate.
Velarias
Inky shadows and dark designs rule the tunnels below the sun-scorched, rocky hills that hide the township of Velarias. Even though no sane soul trusts the furtive Wraiths who reside here in great numbers and the region is completely barren, vagabonds, scoundrels, and smugglers frequent the town often enough to make these caverns a popular stop for comitati of the shadier variety.
Deserted Cove
An old, abandoned, collapsed pier reaching into the muddy waters beyond the fog-covered shore; a decrepit hovel half-sunk into the bog; a swamp abuzz with a myriad of blood-sucking insects. What could possibly make someone come to this forsaken place?

Carravhon, the Howling City
At the heart of a vast, jagged plain where the winds have gone mad sits forsaken Carravhon, hidden from mortal and immortal eyes alike, enveloped in a perpetual whirlwind of mind-scorching rage. Its moans and screams echo in the wasteland, stirring up horrors and carrying nightmares. Could you be the first in centuries to look upon the pristine white walls and golden domes of its slender, accursed towers?

Tenebnemus
Tor'Zag's Shelter
Though the vast caverns and tunnels inside Blackblood Mountain merely gave refuge to Warleader Tor’Zag many centuries past, the Imperial city of Tenebvitris - or as people have been persistently calling it: Tor’Zag’s Shelter - that sprung up there following the war managed to transform into one of the most important settlements on the continent. Often referred to as ‘Sergorod’s City’, the Shelter not only houses the Cathedral of the Raging One in its immense, everdark caves but is also a bustling trading settlement and the center of obsidian harvesting in the region. Thousands toil and haggle under its wrought iron chandeliers every day while servants of the Master of Curses deal out justice in the name of their malevolent God.
Vitrar
Hidden among the endless sand dunes of the deep desert is the sacred, lush oasis of the Sadirar water worshippers: Vitrar. The clear pools and streams running through primitive aqueducts are kept blessed by the blue-clad shamans and are guarded fiercely by the warriors of the tribe. Yet no soul would ever dream of befouling the waters of Vitrar - the oasis is simply too valuable for all travelers of the Searing Plains.
Hurran
Lumen
Those persistent enough to travel towards the blinding light and scorching heat of the South Calerus eventually reach the town of Lumen and glimpse its sandstone buildings protected by its shielding wall; yet most of the settlement was built under the sands, sheltered from the lethal temperatures and unbearable shine of the surface. At night, brigades of prospectors flood the still-searing crystal forest to get their hands on as rich a bounty as they can, hauling it back to Lumen’s bustling underground markets. Apart from Imperial crystal harvesting, the town is famous for its resident Crystalmancers, ever delving into the secrets of the calerus.
Necropolis Nobilis
The Forsaken Colony
The failure of industrious entrepreneurism made manifest, the Forsaken Colony is tucked away in a valley of mines among a cluster of barely traversable, jagged hills. Ever since House Cavadius abandoned their venture here, the bleak ruins have stood silently in this lonely wasteland.
Dawn
Kotrar
The tribe that dwells in Kotrar does not seem to mind the never ending windstorm that keeps beating on sandstone and people alike here. And why should they? The Great Wind Spirit has blessed this place like no other and they, its followers, are a persistent people. It is said that among the many white windmills and whistling totems, the gales whisper truths from distant places, and so the Kotrar know every visitor’s heart before they set foot in their village.
The Crimson Gate
Standing in the long shadow of the massive, crimson fortress that guards the southwestern passage into the Dragonlands makes one feel tiny and insignificant. Drake riders circle in the sky while soldiers clad in red Dragonsteel patrol the gigantic stairway that travelers must ascend to be able to petition the Dragonlords. The tremendous might and majesty of the Dragonlands is perhaps nowhere as apparent as it is beneath the Crimson Gate.
Oil Field Rinaris
The Emerald Haven
Temple of the Sleepers
Incredibly ancient and irreversibly cursed, this cyclopean temple of the Varotians have watched over the valley in silence for millennia. The stone face is carved with incredibly intricate designs depicting the history of a people who themselves are now only history. Yet its true secrets remain locked inside, unknowable and unseen until someone brave - or foolish - enough breaks the seals and enters the darkness. Until then, the Temple sleeps, just like the valley and the extinct people interred there.

Crystal
It is no wonder that a town called ‘Crystal’ was named after the abundantly available resource right beyond its confines - a calerus of yellow, shoddy material that is as lethal during the day as any other crystal forest in the region. The settlement itself is still a budding venture, with rival Trading Houses vying for power and profit over the area, perhaps ignorant to the fact that the blinding and searing calerus is a less promising and more troublesome than they had envisioned.

Ventulium
Eerie, high-pitched music floats across the jagged plains and draws travelers towards a rock shelf where a grand spire stands so tall that it seems to pierce the clouds. The intricately carved stone plays strange melodies ceaselessly under the hot gaze of the cruel sun. If Ventulium is the instrument, the constant wind is the musician; though one can only guess who the composer might be.
The Tombs of Zagakar
Crossroads
Three large marble obelisks stand silently where the Emperor’s Road and the Windway meet. Sometimes comitati stop here before continuing their arduous journeys north, south, or east. The standing stones care little for such visitors for they have witnessed so many of their short-lived kind pass by. The whistling of the wind and the swirling dust never ceases here.
The Lonely Stone
Bridgewright's Comfort
Port Navarum
Ash
Choked by the grey silt constantly floating over the colorless plains that wandered into the northwestern Jagged Waste, Ash is a perilous, depressing town that is barely under Imperial jurisdiction. Slavers and bounty hunters flocked here and turned the place into a frequented market that deals in servitude and suffering. Those found unwanted are sent into the pits to die. More grist for the mill, as they say.
Larnak
It is hard to believe that life can thrive anywhere in the scorching, sandy deserts of the Searing Plains until one sees Larnak. Occupying cyclopean caves carved by water from rock, the city is covered in perpetual gloom only broken by the spear-like shafts of sunlight stabbing down through the large holes in the cave roof. The light caresses the surface of the vast underground lakes during the day, and this climate gave rise to the eerily luminescent brightkelp plantations that elevated the city to be the region’s largest and wealthiest. Strange people were drawn to this place to form a peculiar frontier society, including Sadirar nomads coming here to worship the Water Spirit and even the alien Yskorri whose hive hangs precariously over Larnak.
Hive Slatnyysha
Lavarra Mines
Ioscian Quarry
What does one do when their quarry runs out of ore but is situated on the border of the Plains of Bone? Evidently, one turns it into a scavenging outpost for bone and ivory. Under the faded banners of the industrious House Oquo, an army of slaves and exploited free agents swarm out each day to risk life and limb against bone storms and marauding mutants to be able to haul back a worthy bounty from the macabre wasteland to the south. Grave robbing has never been so profitable.

Angred
Auguros Work Camp
The stench of sweat and excrement hangs heavy in the air among the thousands of hovels that make up the Auguros Work Camp. Half-starved and thoroughly-beaten convicts eye passers-by cautiously. The thought of escape is strange to these sad inhabitants, as the lands beyond the many fences and walls here are so desolate that death is sure to find those insane enough to run, and so the camp has become a tyrannical testament to the notion that the suffering of some is the foundation of the profits of others.
Kernak Waystation
Sheltered in an arid basin, surrounded by stone walls, and guarded by grim mercenaries, Kernak station provides all the illusion of safety most travelers crave. Yet a quick glance at the many signs of past destruction tells a tale of raiders, rock-storms or worse. Despite rebuilding time and again, it is not long before the Jagged Waste claims this place for good.
Onais
Zerutani
Quathos
Utvorar
Home to the eponymous Utvorar tribe of fire worshippers, this village is one of the few permanent settlements the Sadirar folk have. Poised on the edge of a large, barren plateau, protected from the raging heat of nearby lava lakes, rows of soot-covered sandstone houses and tents await visitors. Everything is painted orange and red - the holy colors of the Great Fire Spirit: clothes, awnings, banners, and even faces.

Nestled beneath the thicket of rock pillars called the Arkoros Forest, the Imperial town of Arken is constantly beaten by wind and engulfed in fine dust from the Jagged Waste. However unforgivable though its surroundings are, the settlement’s inhabitants thrive thanks to the earth’s abundant bounty: marble, limestone, granite, and shale. Artists and artisans carve the precious stones in their workshops and warehouses ceaselessly behind the town’s silt-laden walls, under the watchful eyes of the Praetor.
Zantoranti
Scorponar
Salum
Beaten incessantly by the scorching rays of the cruel sun, quiet Salum is sitting at the southernmost point of desolate Brine Mere, a once beautiful inner sea. Its clusters of sandstone buildings are home to a handful of factions from the nearby Dragonlands, and the terraces beyond the town are fabled to be rich in salt beyond compare and yet the region’s masters have been reluctant to tap into that magnificent wealth. Colourful awnings provide shade and beneath them, deals for the coveted white powder are struck with great fervor. Beyond the low walls, the blindingly white flats stretch to the northern horizon - a promise of a bright future for some, the looming threat of an agonizing death to others.

What fate befell ancient Vratluk? Historians only seem to agree on one thing: the great city was destroyed long before the Calamity and even at the height of their power, Imperials kept a safe distance from its crumbling ziggurats and collapsed walls. Now half-sunk into the desert, Vratluk still clings onto a pointless existence even if barely. Could it be that you are among the first souls to lay eyes upon its ruins in centuries?
Bakku Dadd
Tarrok Work Camp
Leviathan's Demise
Legends speak of the cyclopean, vaguely Draconic beast’s remains that lie at the heart of the grim Plains of Bone, untouched by time and undisturbed by scavengers. Yet seeing the mountain-sized skeleton with one’s own eyes is awe and fear inspiring beyond what is imaginable. The Gods were right to strike down such a creature, for its wings would send hurricanes across the land and its steps would summon earthquakes. Perhaps they were jealous of such might.
Bralkorna
Fort Refugis
Forlorn and forgotten, the ruins of the old Imperial fortress that was meant to turn the tide of war against Dragmolac now stands as a monument to the might of the Black Brood instead. Whispers keep spreading about a haven for scum and villainy hiding among the broken walls and shattered towers. Here, at the end of the world, who would notice?
Dum Azkhalar
Sadirar
Saddling the feet of the hallowed Mountain of Kor, the most sacred place of the Sadirar people, this village is the closest to a capital for these desert-dwelling nomads. Few are awarded the right to address or even see the council of shamans that governs all the tribes from this remote, desolate place and not many travelers come here to trade or negotiate in the first place. And yet the village named Sadirar thrives. If it is indeed due to the blessings of the Great Spirits or merely to the toiling of religious zealots is difficult to say.

Ever since the Yrgs that dug the maze-like tunnels among these bleak rocks disappeared, every sane soul has avoided this spot. What kind of a place is so forlorn that even these overgrown insects would abandon it?
Sun Rock
It is said that even a single hero can make a difference. In the case of Sun Rock, this certainly seems true. The mythical warrior Lavendius defeated a terrible monster and founded the town all by himself, entering the hall of Imperial saints in the process. Locals here worship his image and deeds with amazing fervor, not perturbed at all that Lavendius may never have existed. The dome-shaped rock shell protecting Sun Rock keeps the scars of the ancient Wyrms as a grim reminder that the wasteland is never truly conquered. Under it, a busy maze of cool caverns and large halls awaits weary travelers.
Ajid Nakhar
Taludhor Mines
Broken Ridge Mine
Avernum
On the tip of the Molten Tongue, guarding the arid Smolderbone Flats, lies the Imperial city of Avernum behind its sun-scorched walls of bone and dark stone. The many forges and furnaces here toil relentlessly, belching foul smoke day and night under the watchful gaze of the Prefectus, who commands his black-hearted Avernus Legion from the imposing Slagfort. Many comitati, merchants, and grifters flock to Avernum in the hopes of finding trade, rest or work; often, only cruelty and dark deals await them in this corrupt city under burning skies.
Bel Ilgaliad
Tectum Kelvar
What foul grave is this, upturned and broken apart, its accursed contents spilt across the wasteland? Surely, its gaping maw is found exactly where the forgotten vault of Kelvar should be but can they be one and the same? One would have to delve into the great crag and the skittering darkness below to find out.

Yet its twisting innards promise perilous secrets, and so fools brave the darkness below from time to time.

The sun watches indifferently while the carrion birds grow fat around Mirage.

Hard stone and luminous crystals constitute this remote village that lies in the shadow of the great mountains of the west. Its inhabitants, the Eitrar tribe worship the Great Earth Spirit and so they interpret the rumbling of the ground that is so common this close to the once great Dwarven kingdom as the voice of their deity. Indeed, the exquisite bounties of the earth that the people so casually gather here seem to indicate that some sort of a divine will is at work.
The Grand Necropolis

The Spires
Ancient, unknowable, impossibly tall, impervious to damage, and so black they seem to swallow the light, the Spires have watched silently over the wasteland around Deven for a millennium. What was their purpose and who created them? It is unlikely that mortals of this Age will ever know.

A tower of dark rock guards the great valley between the imposing Blackblood Mountains and Sergorod’s Blade, ever vigilant, ever menacing under ashen skies, garrisoning the Empire’s finest and bravest. Yet duty at such a remote and desolate place can grind away watchfulness and boredom has been known to turn the most loyal of warriors into marauders. Vigilus, however, has a grand reputation to uphold.

The Twin Towers
Standing on either side of the only traversable pass across the barren Sepis Mountains like a pair of ancient, weather-beaten guardsmen, the Twin Towers are said to be the gateway between the Imperial hearthlands and the ‘lands beyond’. Yet they appear merely as two decrepit fortresses, huddled beneath walls of rock, one abandoned, the other guarded by a grim legion - and thus the gateway becomes a barrier.
