Its people, the Tarkians are a divided lot - city dwellers typically support Imperial rule, having adapted to a profitable symbiosis, while most desert tribes detest what they see as an occupation force. Tarkian culture is exotic to Imperial eyes, and its many unique products have permeated the Empire throughout the centuries but this is not true the other way round. Originating from desert nomads, Tarkians are great at navigating and surviving arid wastelands and are all said to be merchants at heart. Sometimes this means they have a suspicious or unsavory reputation elsewhere.

Tarkians have dusky skin and dark hair."÷""

Its people, the Dajmahans, are the descendants of ancient Zenrak, having lived mostly in fractured tribal communities since that old empire’s fall. Dajmaha was miraculously spared from the Calamity, yet magical anomalies and mutants did enter its boundaries afterwards. Several centuries ago, a clan of Dajmahan sorceresses rose to rule the land from three city states on the coast. The Empire has made several attempts to colonize Dajmaha but it has proved impossible as of yet. Dajmahans are often athletic and possess incredible stamina but are considered savages by others.

Dajmahans are dark skinned and dark haired."÷""

However, the Orcs soon found out about the deceit of their masters and rebelled against them. Following a brutal war that nearly collapsed the Empire and made Orcs nigh-extinct, a tenuous status quo was reached in the end, and the surviving Orcs relocated to the swamplands of Darkmoor at the edge of the Empire. Living in tribal societies there ever since, Orcs have become a thorn in the side of everyone, raiding, marauding, and engaging in piracy ceaselessly. Their spirit faith is propagated by shamans and meshes surprisingly well with Orcish warrior culture. Many Orcs find work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and gladiators throughout the Empire, though fear and suspicion surrounds them.

Orcs are muscular, athletic, sturdy, and possess amazing stamina. They are human-sized, with black hair and skin that ranges in color from green to brownish."÷""

Most of them retain the pointed ears, magnificent sight, and light-footedness of their Elven parent as well as the adaptability of their human one. They do not have a culture or realm of their own and typically live their lives on the road or among other folk.

The several thousand survivors of the cataclysm became a wandering people, at the same time coveting and hating the technology that they think led to their downfall.

The people survived as three separate clans and rejoined the Empire when it reemerged. Crystal is everywhere in Sargot Kala, the richest and most important of the three regions, so crystal harvesting, crystal growing, and Crystalmancy has become the major occupation in the region.

Each type of Demon produces a set of traits in its Demonkin typical to its own form and abilities. Demonkin came to be fairly common on the continent after the Calamity, as the cataclysm broke the barriers between the Outer Realms and Xeryn, allowing denizens of the Abyss to enter and thrive in the Riven Realms, and to mingle with its mortal inhabitants. Demonkin do not have a culture or realm of their own but live among other races, most frequently humans.

Shunned and stripped of their immortality, this progenitor clan sought refuge underground and found solace in the perpetual darkness and the embrace of Demonic worship. They hate light and the sun that burned their eyes and revealed them for what they truly were. In the next several thousand years, they conquered the deep places, built their underground great cities, and became a power to be reckoned with. After the Calamity, many of them relocated below Xeryn from their northern realms as it seemed to be both a new frontier and a place that became more hospitable to their needs. Loosely allied with the Empire, many Dark Elves are known to worship Demons, among whom Bal Ur Kaal is chief.

The Empire managed to survive the Calamity, albeit at great cost, and remains one of the greatest powers on the continent of Xeryn. At its peak, few - if any - realms could match its prosperity, knowledge, and power, though this came at the cost of slavery and the oppression of other nations. Imperials in the Fourth Age are usually proud of such a past, though it is sometimes fused with a sense of bitterness. Business and progress are also close to the Imperial spirit and the heritage of building a great society still lingers in the post-Calamity era.

Imperials are light of skin and often dark of hair, though people of Daromarian heritage tend to be tall and fair haired."÷""

Her dark past is full of violence and surviving what she had made her a very tough customer. That history makes her distrustful and sometimes even cruel. Criftaa is Tainted and although the transformation clearly took a great toll on her mind, it gave her amazing sight and reflexes in turn. She is an excellent shot with the bow and an accomplished huntress on top of that. Whether the target is a beast or a person, Criftaa has little to no qualms and rarely misses her mark."÷""
"rec387kUISBEZo7an"÷"Character"÷"Renkailon"÷""÷"Renkailon is a Dark Elf and thus is not a common sight in the sun-drenched northern reaches of the Empire as his kind shuns the light in general. However, through his long life as a wanderer, explorer, and scout-for-hire, Ren has learned how to deal with such inconveniences — and much more. He is a capable fellow, even if somewhat of a coward, preferring to skulk in the background and deal with matters in a subtle way. A veteran of many /comitati/, he has a vast amount of experience coordinating scouts and leading the way. Renkailon is fairly likable and easy-going — for a Dark Elf — but he seems to be harried by something he does not want to disclose."÷""

However, through his long life as a wanderer, explorer, and scout-for-hire, Ren has learned how to deal with such inconveniences — and much more. He is a capable fellow, even if somewhat of a coward, preferring to skulk in the background and deal with matters in a subtle way. A veteran of many /comitati/, he has a vast amount of experience coordinating scouts and leading the way. Renkailon is fairly likable and easy-going — for a Dark Elf — but he seems to be harried by something he does not want to disclose."÷""

In the perpetual gloom of the subterranean chambers luminous crystals and brightkelp braziers grant enough light for businesses to thrive and citizens to build homes. That said, not all the inhabitants of Deven appreciate the light, as the disreputable Wraiths and other dwellers of darkness make up a large portion of the city’s population.
