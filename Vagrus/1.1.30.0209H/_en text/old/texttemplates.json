There they discovered the great slumbering Chthonian, the progenitor of the Wyrms. The Sadirar shamans wrested control of the creature from its insane guardian and poisoned it so that it will not threaten future generations but in doing so, they destroyed any chance of studying it, learning where it came from and what its vast, ancient mind contained.\n"

The focal point of the battles became the distant town of Tectum Carvos and as fate or the Gods would have it, the /vagrus/ played a pivotal role in forging an unlikely alliance against the Wyrms.\n\nOnce a decisive battle was won, the Wyrmslayers braved the Lost City of Vratluk, whence the burrowing horrors came, expecting to find answers to why and how the Sand Wyrms’ resurgence had occurred. There they discovered the great slumbering Chthonian, the progenitor of the Wyrms. The Sadirar shamans wrested control of the creature from its insane guardian and vowed to guard it while studying its vast mind. Such undertakings are never without risks, however, and there is no telling if the Chthonian will threaten the Riven Realms ever again.\n"
