Vitality (VIT) is how much damage the character can sustain. When depleted, Companions are Downed but most enemies are defeated right away.
Power (POW) is used by certain Skills. These Skills can only be used if the character has enough POW to pay for its activation.
Evade (EVD) is a defense mode that allows the defender to avoid damage and effects from an attack entirely. Certain attacks ignore a part of or all of Evade. A successful Evade moves the defender to a random adjacent position.
Armor (ARM) is deducted from damage when the combatant is hit. Some attacks ignore a part of or all of Armor.
Actions (ACT) is the number of times a combatant takes their Turn in a Round. Subsequent Turns are taken after all first Turns are taken by every combatant.
Hardness (HRD) is deducted from damage when the obstacle is hit. Some attacks ignore a part of all of Hardness.
Durability (DUR) is how much damage the obstacle can sustain before being destroyed.

Expected Damage is the extent of VIT loss that the selected Skill will cause if it hits the target. Mitigation and damage avoidance is not calculated.
Accuracy (ACC) is the chance for the Skill to successfully hit the target. Defenses are rolled after hitting the target.
Critical Hit Chance (CRT) is the chance of dealing a critical hit with the Skill. Critical hits cause x1.5 Damage.
Initiative (INI) determines in what order characters receive their turn in a round. Higher INI means the character is likely to act faster.
While a Companion is Downed, they receive their Downed Vitality. If Downed Vitality is depleted, the Companion is defeated and is out of action.
The number of VIT the character regains each round.
Block (BLC) is a defense mode that provides the defender with additional ARM against the current attack. Certain attacks ignore a part of or all of Block.
