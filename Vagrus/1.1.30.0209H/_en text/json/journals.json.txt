*Auto-acquire Supplies* allows you to set conditions through which you can automatically acquire Supplies at the end of the day. Once the conditions are met, *Hunting* and *Foraging* will automatically occur when you end the day from the Camp screen. If you use Quick Camp, the acquisition of the Supplies will happen automatically as well if the preset conditions are met.\n\nThe conditions are represented by two *sliders* underneath Auto-acquire Supplies. The top slider represents the lowest base chance of success through which the auto-acquisition will trigger, while the bottom slider represents the minimum amount of Supplies yielded on average by that node for the auto-acquisition to occur.\n\n<<Image:CampAutoAcquire>>\n\nIf you switch on the *Vigor symbol* (fist icon), Auto-acquisition will cost 1 Vigor instead of 2 Movement Points (MP) when you have less than 2 MPs left. If this is not switched off, *Auto-acquire Supplies* will only trigger when you have 2 or more MPs.\n\n[title Auto-acquire Supplies]\n[parent {6KR3XZEnQRHbu7BL}]\n[order 11]
As an alternative to acquiring supplies when you camp and end the day, you may also acquire supplies during the day.  This can often be useful, as the node you choose to hunt or forage on may have a significant impact on the results.\n\nIn almost all cases, this will cost 2 Movement Points (MP). If you do not have any remaining MP, it will instead cost 1 Vigor. You can send out multiple *Hunting* and *Foraging* expeditions during a day, though these will face diminishing returns depending on the outcome of previous attempts. Daytime supply acquisition is available from the radial menu as you traverse the wasteland, and clicking on it will bring up the UI as shown below.\n\n<<Image:CampDaytimeSupply>>\n\n[title Daytime Supply Acquisition]\n[parent {6KR3XZEnQRHbu7BL}]\n[order 10]

While it is turned off by default, you can activate it in the Options menu under *Game Settings*.

Under *Acquire Supplies*, you can send your crew out into the wasteland to find supplies and sometimes even other goods. Base chances for these activities depend on your related Perks, Deputies, crew, and the region you are in. You can also see the expected yields below each activity. The cost of Hunting and Foraging is Movement Points or Vigor if you are out of MPs. From the camp UI, Hunting and Foraging *results* appear after you end the day – unless you chose to acquire supplies during the day already. The summary of what happened to your crew that day can be seen on the right.\n\n*Hunting*\nHunting uses scouts and has a chance to get you a large number of Supplies. Critical failure might result in the death of scouts. Click on the scouts to allow hunting.\n\n*Foraging*\nForaging is more reliable but yields fewer Supplies.

In most cases that scouting is successful, approximate information is revealed about a node. In the case of manual scouting, this is displayed as part of a list. When you achieve critical success, more precise information is revealed on that list. Failure, on the other hand, results in information with very little accuracy for hunting and foraging, and no information about combat encounters or events, while critical failure often leads to the loss of scouts. Surveying a larger area will yield more results, but also incurs a higher risk of losing more scouts. \n\nThe way results are consolidated is quite different for **manual scouting**, an example of which is shown below:\n\n<<Image:ScoutingResults1>>\n\nTwo upward, green arrows represent critical success, while one represents normal success. The same is true vice versa for failure, all of which appear in the aforementioned list format in the case of manual scouting.\n\nAfter you choose to move on, scouting results will remain on the map for three days. This is true for both manual and auto-scouting. \n\nHowever, because **auto-scouting** functions quite differently, results do not come up in a list,  you will instead be stopped when surrounding nodes meet the conditions of your auto-scouting, and nodes are revealed on the campaign map, such as shown below:\n\n<<Image:ScoutingResults2>>\n\n[title Scouting Results]\n[parent {nPr3XZEphRHbu7BM}]\n[order 3]\n\n\n\n\n

Auto-scouting allows you to scout ahead of your /comitatus/ without spending movement points. The main trade-off of doing so is that your chances of success are significantly reduced when compared to manual scouting, which also means that you may lose scouts more frequently while auto-scouting.\n\nAdditionally, there are two modes of auto-scouting. One is represented by a single leftward arrow on the UI beside auto-scout mode, and the second is by the icon with multiple arrows leading in different directions. With the former, your /comitatus/ can stop on any node along its current trajectory when certain conditions are met, while with the latter mode you are stopped when any of the adjacent surrounding nodes meet the conditions. These conditions can be set up corresponding to various thresholds for hunting and scouting ($acquiring supplies), the strength of a $Crew Combat encounter, or by the chance of an event occurring on a given node. An example is provided below:\n\n<<Image:AutoScouting1>>\n\nIn this example hunting and foraging are being used as conditions for the /comitatus/ to stop, along with the singular auto-scouting mode (represented by the single arrow) which means that your /comitatus/ will only stop when the base chance of 30% or higher is met, along with an average yield of 150 or more supplies from that node. When considering avoiding or engaging foes, the combat encounter conditions instead use a minimum and maximum power whereby your traveling company will stop, with anything outside of those parameters being ignored as you traverse the wasteland.\n\n<<Image:AutoScouting2>>\n\n[title Auto-scouting]\n[order 2]\n[parent {nPr3XZEphRHbu7BM}]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Toggling *Automarch* on in the Options menu under *Game Settings* will make it so that when you choose to travel beyond your normal Movement Points (MP) limit, your /comitatus/ will proceed forward and expend March Points automatically.

Forced March allows your /comitatus/ to move farther than your maximum *Movement Points (MPs)* would normally allow you. Forced March uses *Marching MPs* (indicated next to your MPs on the top left). Marching along paths and its cost is indicated in red on the campaign map. Your crew loses Vigor and even Morale rapidly if you March too often without extra resting.\n\n[title Forced March]\n[parent {HS93XZEa5RHbu7BJ}]\n[order 3]
Manual scouting covers anything from the node you occupy to a larger surrounding area that stretches out far into the distance. The more distance covered, the higher the movement points (MP) cost. The amount of movement points needed is also dependent on the amount of scouts you choose to send, as is illustrated below:\n\n<<Image:ManualScouting1>>\n\nIn the above example, six scouts will be sent out and the nodes in blue will be covered. The cost of this is five movement points. In the next example, twenty-five scouts are used, vastly reducing the cost to 2 MP, while simultaneously drastically increasing the chance of success, which is represented by the green bars and numbers in each example.\n\n<<Image:ManualScouting2>>\n\nFinally, using more scouts will allow you to increase the distance that you cover, which is represented by the indicated distance which shows 3 from a maximum of 8 in the above example. Increasing the distance covered will in turn ramp up the MP cost exponentially, while also decreasing your chance of success, but it will allow you to cover vast expanses of land. A final example shows the maximum distance coverable in this situation:\n\n<<Image:ManualScouting3>>\n\nIn all cases with manual scouting, $resourcefulness can be used to bolster one or more categories, guaranteeing the acquisition of information by choosing the upward arrow next to it. That outcome will result in details being revealed regardless of whether or not the actual roll for scouting was a success or a failure. In cases where the scouting check is failed, the list will nonetheless show information related to the category that the /vagrus/ boosted. \n\n[title Manual Scouting]\n[order 1]\n[parent {nPr3XZEphRHbu7BM}]

Scouting allows you to gather information about what is going to happen in nearby nodes before committing your /comitatus/ to a path forward. This is done by sending your scouts out. Scouting is divided into two categories: $manual scouting and $auto-scouting. Both forms serve the purpose of revealing important information about combat encounters, hunting, foraging, and $events in the surrounding area. \n\nThe details revealed correspond to the chance that $Crew Combat will happen on that node, the base chance of success for $acquiring supplies via hunting and foraging, and the chance that an event will happen. When an event is guaranteed to happen, it will be displayed in the form of a blue scroll because it is a priority event.

On the campaign map, your /comitatus/ (traveling company) always occupies a *node* and moves between nodes along *paths*. Doing so costs *Movement Points* (MPs), indicated next to each path.
