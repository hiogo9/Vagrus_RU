A land of vast deserts, arid mountains, and tranquil oases, Tark has long been a problematic yet prosperous province of the Empire. Its people, the Tarkians are a divided lot - city dwellers typically support Imperial rule, having adapted to a profitable symbiosis, while most desert tribes detest what they see as an occupation force. Tarkian culture is exotic to Imperial eyes, and its many unique products have permeated the Empire throughout the centuries but this is not true the other way round. Originating from desert nomads, Tarkians are great at navigating and surviving arid wastelands and are all said to be merchants at heart. Sometimes this means they have a suspicious or unsavory reputation elsewhere.\n\nTarkians have dusky skin and dark hair.

Dajmaha, the Land of Endless Rain occupies the northeastern peninsula of the continent of Xeryn, cut off from most other regions by vast mountain ranges and dense jungles. Its people, the Dajmahans, are the descendants of ancient Zenrak, having lived mostly in fractured tribal communities since that old empire's fall. Dajmaha was miraculously spared from the Calamity, yet magical anomalies and mutants did enter its boundaries afterwards. Several centuries ago, a clan of Dajmahan sorceresses rose to rule the land from three city states on the coast. The Empire has made several attempts to colonize Dajmaha but it has proved impossible as of yet. Dajmahans are often athletic and possess incredible stamina but are considered savages by others.\n\nDajmahans are dark skinned and dark haired.

Orc
Having been summoned as roaming souls from the Outer Realms and given bodies in a ritual of unmatched sorcerous power, Orcs were created as the perfect warriors without memories: weapons of the Empire in their war on the northern continent about 350 years before present day. However, the Orcs soon found out about the deceit of their masters and rebelled against them. Following a brutal war that nearly collapsed the Empire and made Orcs nigh-extinct, a tenuous status quo was reached in the end, and the surviving Orcs relocated to the swamplands of Darkmoor at the edge of the Empire. Living in tribal societies there ever since, Orcs have become a thorn in the side of everyone, raiding, marauding, and engaging in piracy ceaselessly. Their spirit faith is propagated by shamans and meshes surprisingly well with Orcish warrior culture. Many Orcs find work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and gladiators throughout the Empire, though fear and suspicion surrounds them.\n\nOrcs are muscular, athletic, sturdy, and possess amazing stamina. They are human-sized, with black hair and skin that ranges in color from green to brownish.

*Vagrus* is a difficult game in a variety of ways. One of the most common mistakes you can make is to *expand too fast* initially, since nothing warns you of the more hidden economical consequences. Instead, focus on *Faction Trade Tasks* - these will take you to new locations and by working on them, you accumulate much needed money reserves. Many *Mercenary Tasks* are extremely difficult for a new /comitatus/.\n\nFighting outlaws or creatures is not an income source in general. Try to avoid conflict whenever you can unless on an active Mercenary Task or quest to combat them.\n\nYou are likely to run into a few death spirals before getting the hang of it, so do not be discouraged if it happens. If you feel that the learning curve is too steep, though, we recommend starting a new game in *Dissonance Mode* and once you are confident there, consider returning to the *Wasteland Mode*.

Combat is cruel and in general you can not heal during it. Your defenses are your main way to mitigate damage.\n\n*Evade* allows you to completely avoid an attack but you will be moved to an adjacent unoccupied position after a successful Evade. That also means that they may move away from a position that protects another Companion.\n\nA successful *Block* provides extra ARM against the attack, mitigating more damage. However, you can still suffer damage while blocking and also suffer adverse effects from an attack.\n\nEach Companion has different Evade and Block chance but because certain Skills are better against one or the other, you often have to change these by clicking the *Defense Mode* icon (shield or dodging figure) at the character portrait.

Victory or Defeat are determined based on a number of factors. Success and Critical Success in rounds earns one and two victory points, respectively. Additionally, Attackers gather points for succeeding in fulfilling their goal. Defenders get points both for preventing Attackers and for keeping their crew alive.\n\nThe side with more victory points in the end wins, while in case of a tie, the side with the more wins during the three rounds is considered victorious.\n\nThe post-victory sequence involves looting. You can receive Items, Goods, or even Beast and Mounts depending on the enemy you defeated. As with all opportunities of revenue in the game, relying on this sort of loot alone will not keep you afloat.

You can now see the *results* of your scouting. The success of your scouting in each direction is indicated by the chevron icons next to each direction.\n\nFor each direction with a *Successful* scouting, percentages appear with icons related to the certain encounter types. The *Scroll* icon indicates an Event (either a priority or a chance Event), the *Axe* icon indicates a combat encounter, the *Compass* icon indicates an exploration node [not yet available], and the *Crossed-out Circle* icon indicates that nothing happens.\n\nIn case of a *Critical Success*, you get more precise information. The *blue Scroll* icon indicates an available priority Event (story-related or fixed local Event), while the *golden Scroll* icon indicates a random Event (general or specific to the region).\n\n*Failed* scouting provides no information on Events, while a *Critical Failure* also incurs losses to your Scouts.\n\nScouting also provides information about the viability of *hunting and foraging* on the scouted nodes. Percentages represent the expected chances of such activities on the nodes. The less successful the scouting, the less accurate the percentages are (with *Critical Success* being perfectly accurate).
Close the Scouting results by clicking 'x' or the 'Move on' button.

You will probably lose everything several times before getting the hang of leading your traveling company.\n\nVagrus is also a labor of love, created by a tiny team that dared dream big with the support of an amazing little community. We are extremely grateful to all those that helped us along the way with constructive criticism.\n\n\n<color=#d2a14d>Hold Space.

Half-Elf
Not all Dor Anthelas Elves took their own lives after the Calamity or became embittered to the point of insanity. Some of them wandered out into the world and lived out their remaining years among the mortals who survived. These Elves mingled with humans and their progeny are known as the Pereldin, the Half-Elves. Most of them retain the pointed ears, magnificent sight, and light-footedness of their Elven parent as well as the adaptability of their human one. They do not have a culture or realm of their own and typically live their lives on the road or among other folk. Most Gwaeth Elves consider them abominations and most humans think of them as Elves, treacherous and furtive, so they do not trust them.\n\nHalf-Elves are tall and lean, with a mostly Elvish appearance yet also some human traits.

Renkailon is a Dark Elf and thus is not a common sight in the sun-drenched northern reaches of the Empire as his kind shuns the light in general. However, through his long life as a wanderer, explorer, and scout-for-hire, Ren has learned how to deal with such inconveniences — and much more. He is a capable fellow, even if somewhat of a coward, preferring to skulk in the background and deal with matters in a subtle way. A true veteran of many /comitati/, he has vast experience coordinating scouts and leading the way. Ren is fairly likeable and easy-going — for a Dark Elf — but he seems to be harried by something he does not want to disclose.

Vorax means “gluttonous” in the Imperial tongue, a name this Undead earned because he keeps devouring food even though his dead innards can no longer digest it. This is something of a mystery rivaling only his reason for returning from the echoing halls of Tartaris. Garrulous and jovial, Vorax recalls nothing from his former life except for his cooking skills. That — coupled with his obsession with food, as well as his exceptionally sharp mind — makes him a great quartermaster. He seems to be solely interested in campfire stories and good eating but some believe that terrible secrets are hiding beneath all that geniality. Vorax pays little mind to them, however, only wishing to please.

The mighty Dwarven kingdom of Dvendar Tharr was the greatest ally of the Empire before the Calamity, and gifted humans most secrets of metal and stone. Dwarven technology was a true marvel, and the line of Inventor Kings governed the kingdom into a golden age of progress. When the Calamity struck, most of Dvendar Tharr was cursed and destroyed in a conflagration of fire and lava as the great mountains that they were built upon and into erupted. The several thousand survivors of the cataclysm became a wandering people, at the same time coveting and hating the technology that they think led to their downfall.

This decade saw the rise of a coterie of outlaws there, led by a bitter man who wanted to strike back at the Empire that spurned him.\nThe /vagrus/ joined these outlaws and drew the Imperials hunting the malcontents into a trap that saw their downfall. And so the Thirsty Maggots eke out a difficult existence in the no-man's land that is Hargad Tuul, tolerated by the Dragons and scorned by the Imperials. For now.

Its maximum can be raised by spending Insight on it (click the '+' button). What you can spend Resourcefulness on depends on your unlocked Leadership Perks.\n\n*Authority* is the maximum number of Deputies you can have at any given time.

*Vagrus* is a hard game and while Dissonance Mode includes a number of ways to make it easier, it is in no way easy, so you must keep your wits about you. One of the most common mistakes you can make is to *expand too fast* initially, since nothing warns you of the more hidden economical consequences. Instead, focus on *Faction Trade Tasks* - these will take you to new locations and by working on them, you accumulate much needed money reserves. Many *Mercenary Tasks* are extremely difficult for a new /comitatus/.\n\nFighting outlaws or creatures is not an income source in general. Try to avoid conflict whenever you can unless on an active Mercenary Task or quest to combat them.\n\nYou are likely to run into a few death spirals before getting the hang of it, so do not be discouraged.

Some crew combat encounters offer you the option to *flee*.\n\nWhile trying to flee, your Combat Strength is significantly reduced. The *chance to flee successfully* is derived from a variety of sources, including crew composition, equipment, crew combat attributes, and the opponent's *Chase* value. Even in case of a successful flee, the /comitatus/ suffers damage.\n\nIn some cases, you also have the option to *appease* your opponent.\n\nDoing so offers you the chance to leave behind cargo and other resources to lessen the damage of fleeing or outright get away unharmed. Different foes are appeased by different offerings while they are indifferent to other offerings. This can often be discerned by studying their combat attributes.

Crew Combat typically lasts for *three rounds* (#1) during which you need to manage who of your crew fights and who does not, as well as increase your chances of success or modify outcomes by performing special actions each round.\n\nEach round you roll to see how successfully you attack or defend. The chances of success and failure (derived from the Combat Strengths, Defense, and action modifiers of the two sides) can be seen in the middle. (#2)\n\nIf the enemy successfully Flees, Retreats, or Disengages at any given round, you can choose to pursue them or to stand down. The enemy can do the same to you in case your side withdraws. Additionally, if it is not wiped out at the end of the third round, your crew - if not in a hurry - has the chance to save the wounded by healing them.

Rumor has it that she sometimes shares these journeys with someone close to her.

Under *Acquire Supplies*, you can send your crew out into the wasteland to find supplies and sometimes even other goods. Base chances for these activities depend on your related Perks, Deputies, crew, and the region you are in. You can also see the expected yields below each activity. The cost of Hunting and Foraging is Movement Points or Vigor (if you are out of MPs).\n\n*Hunting* uses scouts and has a chance to get you a large number of Supplies. Critical failure might kill scouts. Click on the scouts to allow hunting. #1\n\n*Foraging* is more reliable but yields fewer Supplies. It can use workers and slaves - you can add them to or remove them from the activity by clicking on their crew portraits. Critical failure might kill workers or slaves. #2 #3\n\nFrom the camp UI, Hunting and Foraging *results* appear after you end the day.

The former kingpin and veteran warrior Skornar, called “The Blue-faced”, does not hail from Xeryn but from the green continent in the north. Generally, this would mean capture and persecution, yet the fierce marauder not only avoided this fate but managed to build a life and business for himself in the Riven Realms. Fearless and clever, he was respected by all, but even still, ambitious young blood saw the time to remove the aging mob boss eventually. Skornar is not someone to be easily disposed of, however, and having survived the ordeal, he is eager to pay treachery back in kind. Many would underestimate him due to his age but he still wields his shield and axe with deadly proficiency.

Marching along paths and its cost is indicated by red on the campaign map.\n\nAlthough Forced Marches get you further, use them carefully. Your crew loses Vigor and even Morale rapidly if you March too often without extra resting.\n\nWe strongly suggest refraining from frequent Forced Marches until you have more experience.

Finndurarth is a Dragonkin from the brood of the Blue Dragonlord. Ever since she was a child, she has been told that she is destined for greatness, which perfectly explains her sense of entitlement and self-righteousness. Yet when presented with opportunities at the Hall of Voices on a silver platter, she rather chose the dangerous position of diplomatic attaché to foreign lands, wishing to prove that she can do well without her family's influence. As a pureblood Dragonmage, she can wreak havoc using lightning-based magic and protect the /comitatus/ from arcane threats. Finndurarth is educated in a number of scholarly topics as well, and her charisma is undeniable.

The former diplomatic attaché and promising Dragonmage Finndurarth found companionship with the /comitatus/ by chance. Although she was considered naive and inexperienced by many, she was eventually successful in discovering a dark conspiracy as well as in laying the foundations of an alliance with the Oghres. In the end, she kept the identity of the true culprits to herself, hoping to prevent a schism between her homeland's factions. Years later, she took up the mantle of a Voice of the Dragonlord Doranmathar.

One of the greatest challenges that the inhabitants of the Searing Plains had to face was the sudden invasion of the Sand Wyrms. The vile abominations swarmed out of the desert in previously unseen numbers to fall upon everyone, marauding and slaying indiscriminately. The focal point of the battles became the distant town of Tectum Carvos and as fate or the Gods would have it, the /vagrus/ played a pivotal role in forging an unlikely alliance against the Wyrms.\n\nOnce a decisive battle was won, the Wyrmslayers braved the Lost City of Vratluk, whence the burrowing horrors came, expecting to find answers to why and how the Sand Wyrms' resurgence had occurred. There they discovered the great slumbering Chthonian, the progenitor of the Wyrms. The Sadirar shamans wrested control of the creature from its insane guardian and poisoned it so that it will not threaten future generations but in doing so, they destroyed any chance of studying it, learning where it came from and what its vast, ancient mind contained.\n

Before the first round is started, you have to deploy your Companions to the available *positions* on the friendly (left) side. You do not need to deploy all your Companions; sometimes it is best to avoid sending a wounded Companion into battle or simply to leave some space to maneuver. You can start combat by clicking the *Begin Fight* button.\n\nYou can *deploy* a Companion by selecting their portrait from the roster and clicking on an empty position (or dragging it there). Revert a deployment by clicking on the base of a character. Certain Companions may have different deployment conditions - hover over their portraits to learn more.\n\nBefore deploying a Companion, you can switch between their defense mode (Block or Evade) by clicking the Defense Mode button (shield icon) next to their portrait. Defense modes are set to the higher value mode by default.\n\nYou can use the top right section of the deployment window to save three deployment templates (use Save after selecting a template number) that you can use later (by selecting a template number).
In this fight, some allies are already deployed and you will take control of them but you cannot change their deployment. Morwen #1 is useful in the front row #2, while Javek's #3 abilities favor the back row #4. When you are done deploying, initiate combat by clicking the Begin Fight button.

This is the *Prowess* window, where you can upgrade your Companions. Prowess is the general power level of the Companion, ranging from 1 to 9. Each unlocked level of Prowess gives the Companion an amount of *Proficiency* points that can be spent on upgrading their Perks. Raising Prowess costs *Insight* from the Leader (click on the next Prowess node and confirm  to unlock it). In the main campaign, levels 4, 6, and 8 of Prowess can only be unlocked after the Companion's storyline progresses beyond a certain point. In Pilgrims of the Wasteland, companions can be upgraded up to the third Prowess level.\n\nPerk descriptions and Proficiency costs can be observed by clicking on their names. Deputy Perks, Combat Traits, and Combat Skills are unique to Companions. Combat Traits give them passive bonuses in combat, while Combat Skills are what they use in battle - each level of skill is represented by a Perk. Attributes are used in Event Tests as well as requirements for Combat Skills and Traits, but have no direct effect in combat.\n\n*Upgrading* works the same way as with Leaders: you can spend any amount of Proficiency, then confirm changes with the *confirm button* (bottom right). You can undo all changes by using the *revert button* (bottom left).\n\nBe very careful what you spend Proficiency on: once purchased, Perks can not be changed!
Upgrade Morwen's Prowess #1 and purchase any Perks or Skills you'd like. #2 When finished close this window by clicking the X (top right corner). #3

Combat Actions are commands you can issue before each round of Crew Combat to alter the course of battle, raise your chances of success, or mitigate losses. Maximum two Actions can be performed per combat round - both cost Resourcefulness (the second one costs more than the first).\n\nActions that are in tune with your disposition (Offensive for the Attacker and Defensive for the Defender side) cost less Resourcefulness. Additionally, Marauder Prime and Guard Captain Deputies lower the Resourcefulness cost of Offensive and Defensive Actions, respectively.\n\nApart from the cost, Actions have all sorts of requirements and effects, making them situational to use. Consult each tooltip on these and pick the right ones to optimize your tactics in Crew Combat.

Human (Kalani)
The Kalani people of the east originate from coastal clans who survived the fall of Kimora. Their progressive and wealthy realm joined the Empire in the Golden Age and contributed considerably to the rise of Imperial society and culture. The Calamity struck and vastly changed the face of the eastern regions, erasing Kalani cities and burning the wonderful forests into formations of glass and crystal. The people survived as three separate clans and rejoined the Empire when it reemerged. Crystal is everywhere in Sargot Kala, the richest and most important of the three regions, so crystal harvesting, crystal growing, and Crystalmancy has become the major occupation in the region. Kalani are considered good mediators and a stoic, strong-willed people.\n\nKalani are usually dark haired and fair skinned with blue or green eyes.

*Auto-acquire Supplies* allows you to set conditions through which you can automatically acquire Supplies at the end of the day. Once the conditions are met, *Hunting* and *Foraging* will automatically occur when you end the day from the Camp screen. If you use Quick Camp, the acquisition of the Supplies will happen automatically as well if the preset conditions are met.\n\nThe conditions are represented by two *sliders* underneath Auto-acquire Supplies. The top slider represents the lowest base chance of success through which the auto-acquisition will trigger, while the bottom slider represents the minimum amount of Supplies yielded on average by that node for the auto-acquisition to occur.\n\nIf you switch on the *Vigor symbol* (fist icon), Auto-acquisition will cost 1 Vigor instead of 2 Movement Points (MP) when you have less than 2 MPs left. If this is not switched off, *Auto-acquire Supplies* will only trigger when you have 2 or more MPs.

Shortly before the /vagrus/ began leading the /comitatus/ across the scorched wasteland of terra supra, the unceasing winds went mad following a foreboding set of inexplicable disasters. The gales from then on brought nightmares and insanity, furthering the chaos. This echo of the Calamity tore the Empire apart and bewildered simple folk and powerful leaders alike. But thanks in part to the diligent investigation of the /vagrus/, some of the mystery was unraveled. The source of discord was revealed to be Carravhon, the Howling City, its ancient confines infiltrated and defiled, its slumbering specters awakened to scream and whisper insanity into the wasteland winds. Those most invested in the investigation knew not when or if these phenomena would cease.

Companion Combat is turn-based, where 1-6 enemies fight against your team of 1-6 Companions. You can use the Skills of your Companions to defeat your enemies, protect your Companions, and set yourself up in advantageous positions on the combat board.\n\nCompanion combat is made up of *rounds*. Each round, all the participants take *turns* to act, and when everyone has had their turn, the current round ends and a new round is started. This goes on until either your Companions or your enemies are defeated.\n\nCombat board is divided into two *sides*: the friendly side (left) where your Companions and occasional allies are, and the opponent side (right) where your enemies are. Each side has a *front row* (melee row) and a *back row* (ranged row). Each row has 3 *positions*. Certain skills can only be used when standing in a position in the appropriate row.
Click on the Begin Fight button.

Demonkin\n
Demonkin is a general name for the many beings that have Demonic blood in their veins but it is more specifically used for those who have Demonic ancestry in their grandparents or farther back. The heritage manifests as an aura of uneasiness that surrounds the Demonkin, as well as in physical - and sometimes sorcerous - traits borne by the person. Each type of Demon produces a set of traits in its Demonkin typical to its own form and abilities. Demonkin came to be fairly common on the continent after the Calamity, as the cataclysm broke the barriers between the Outer Realms and Xeryn, allowing denizens of the Abyss to enter and thrive in the Riven Realms, and to mingle with its mortal inhabitants. Demonkin do not have a culture or realm of their own but live among other races, most frequently humans.\n\nDemonkin look fairly human but retain some physical aspects of their Outer Realms ancestors - most commonly horns, fangs, claws, as well as unusual skin and eye color.

Gor'Goro is considered a prodigy among Orcs, especially when his relative youth is taken into account. A warrior of great renown — former gladiator, feared marauder, and drill master — he has already seen more combat than most other fighters do in a lifetime. Yet for some reason, Gor'Goro has not stepped up as a Warleader for his own kin and chose to wander the continent, living as a mercenary instead, unsure about the fate marked out for his people as well as for his own person. Lately a trainer of gladiators and warriors, the young Orc is eager to set out again and explore the continent. With his skills and experience, he can become a great asset to any /comitati/.

The sinister-looking Harvek is a true survivor who has spent much of his life in the Empire's worst penitentiary. After getting involved in criminal activities at a young age, he was eventually arrested and was taken to Purgatoria, considered to be the cruelest prison on the continent. Inmates do not usually make it to their one year anniversary there but Harvek survived for twelve whole years, no small thanks to his transformation due to the Taint, which equipped him with mutations he learned to use as lethal tools. He was eventually released and now he is looking for work. Harvek is usually calm and professional, yet he has something menacing about him, a cruelty that comes natural to the Tainted mercenary.

A Companion is *Downed* after losing all their Vitality (VIT) in combat. They are not removed from combat but can not perform actions. They receive their Downed VIT and occupy their previous position. Enemies can still target them and if they lose all their Downed VIT, they are Out of Action (OOA). This means that they become severely wounded and can even die following combat. Some rare healing skills can bring back Companions from a Downed state. Be sure to protect Downed Companions as much as you can.

Nedir used to study in the Crimson Order, the continent's most powerful and influential covenant of mages. However, her curiosity regarding the darker arts and her no-nonsense attitude led to her leaving the Order, and she ended up wandering the Realms. Yet, this has not quenched her thirst for magical knowledge and Nedir taught herself a lot in the past years, becoming adept at forms of pyromancy, blood magic, mind-altering spells, and even the summoning of Demonic beings. Her confidence and sharpness of mind has made her a formidable individual but there is a darkness in her, feeding on ambition and arrogance, as likely to damn the sorceress as it is to propel her to greatness.

*Upkeep* is how much you owe your crew. You can pay them at the end of each day or keep collecting debt.\n\n*Consumption* is how much food your crew consumes each day. Running out of supplies leads to a quick death in the wastelands.\n\n*Workforce* is generated by workers and slaves. You have to have enough workforce to cover the /comitatus'/ needs, including beasts, crew, and passengers. Going below the required number bestows serious penalties.\n\n*Passengers* are people your /comitatus/ takes to their destinations for rewards. You can take on passengers in some Events and settlements. They also consume supplies (lizard icon).

The Dwarf called Garrik is well-known in the criminal underworld of the central regions. His reputation as a nasty, mean, and malevolent creature is well-deserved, though these traits are generally attributed to Dwarves anyway. Garrik is disinterested in delving into the ruins of his fallen nation — he has built himself a smuggling business instead, which has seen him grow wealthy and influential. That is, until he lost everything due to some ill-fated ventures and loans. Garrik is not one to give up easily though, something perhaps stemming from Dwarvish stubbornness. He is an accomplished businessman and he always has something up his sleeve when it comes to fights.

Be sure to guard your slaves with enough Fighters and treat your slaves well (or punish them consistently) to raise Obedience.\n\n*Nutrition* shows you how well-fed your crew is. Low Nutrition incurs penalties. Extra rations raise Nutrition while starving your crew repeatedly lowers it.\n\n*Vigor* indicates how tired the /comitatus/ is. Low Vigor results in penalties on Tests and in a drastically slower /comitatus/, which can spell doom quite fast. You can see the current effects of your vigor below the rating.

They say that ignorance is bliss, and that often, knowing half the truth is more dangerous than not knowing anything at all. Certainly, this can not be truer than in the case of the Leviathan, whose dark origins the /comitatus/ began discovering in the employ of the researcher and rogue mage Kandake. But despite her boons and rewards, she was abandoned by the /vagrus/ when the dangers of her enterprise were revealed. Whatever happened to the obsessed mage and her mad venture into forbidden knowledge was lost to history but one can safely assume that she never reached her goal or found her coveted proof.

His mind shattered due to a decade of limbo spend under the sands, Sedarias is trying to figure out what or who exactly brought him back. The reason, however, could make him a heretic, the very thing he despises the most. What he lacks from being out of touch, however, he makes up for in cruelty - all in the name of Sergorod of course. Sedarias commands the power of his god to harm his enemies and grant divine rage to his allies. Clad in black iron armor and wielding a steel blade, he is a lethal combatant, only made more effective by his undeath.

*Scouting* allows you to gather information about what is going to happen in neighboring nodes before committing to a path by sending your *scouts* out. You can see all neighboring nodes represented as directions in the Scouting window - these are also marked on the campaign map. Scouting costs *Movement Points*: you need to spend MPs equal to the half of highest MP cost direction rounded down.\n\nYou can add scouts to directions you want to gain information from. Each added scout raises the *chance of a successful scouting*. However, each additional direction (after the second or, if you have a Scout Master, after the fourth) costs *Resourcefulness*. You can see the chances of success and failure for each scouted direction.\n\nScouting is not without risks: your scouts may not return in case of a failure.
Scout at least one direction. After you set up everything, click on the Send Scouts button to send out your scouts. #1

Welcome to 'Pilgrims of the Wasteland', a standalone story of *Vagrus - The Riven Realms*! It serves as an introduction to the setting and also as a tutorial to the game. It behooves you to read the tutorial text and follow the instructions to gain a better understanding of how the game works.\n\nThe #1 icon can be clicked in tutorial windows to show what the section is referring to (via a pointer). Note that you have to be on the right UI screen for the pointer to appear.\n\nAlthough Vagrus is an open world game, due to 'Pilgrims of the Wasteland' being a tutorial, it progresses along a narrow, guided path in the beginning and opens up only later, after the core mechanics have been introduced.\n\nYou can access the Hotkey list by pressing F11.

One of the greatest challenges that the inhabitants of the Searing Plains had to face was the sudden invasion of the Sand Wyrms. The vile abominations swarmed out of the desert in previously unseen numbers to fall upon everyone, marauding and slaying indiscriminately. The focal point of the battles became the distant town of Tectum Carvos and as fate or the Gods would have it, the /vagrus/ played a pivotal role in forging an unlikely alliance against the Wyrms.\n\nOnce a decisive battle was won, the Wyrmslayers braved the Lost City of Vratluk, whence the burrowing horrors came, expecting to find answers to why and how the Sand Wyrms' resurgence had occurred. There they discovered the great slumbering Chthonian, the progenitor of the Wyrms. The Sadirar shamans wrested control of the creature from its insane guardian and vowed to guard it while studying its vast mind. Such undertakings are never without risks, however, and there is no telling if the Chthonian will threaten the Riven Realms ever again.\n

You, the /vagrus/, may not take part directly in Companion combat but that does not mean you have no means to influence it. Many of your *Leadership Perks* allow you to use *Resourcefulness* in various ways in combat. Whichever you have unlocked can be found on the Leader medallion in the form of buttons along with the Menu button (three lines icon). Consult their tooltips to learn what to use them for.\n\nYou have two options for now: \n\n*Aid*, which allows you to revive Downed Companions. The button is only active if you have a Downed Companion. A Companion is *Downed* after losing all their Vitality (VIT). They are not removed from combat but can not act and have to be protected because if their Downed VIT is depleted, they become severely wounded. Downed characters also do not provide cover from Line of Sight attacks to those behind them.\n\n*Inspire*, which gives a substantial defense buff to a target character for 3 rounds.
Use Inspire to give a character additional defenses (select Inspire, #1 click on the target, then click again to confirm). #2

Many settlements have *Faction panes* like this one where you can interact with Factions with a presence at the given location.\n\nEach faction provides a variety of *Tasks* you can take on. Tasks are procedurally generated, non-story related objectives you can complete for *money and reputation* with Factions.\n\nYou can take on Tasks under the *Available* tab. Each has requirements including Faction Standing tiers and free cargo space.\n\nThe *Active* tab is where you can turn in Tasks (if you are at the right place) or discard them. Be mindful that doing so will result in serious penalties.\n\nThe *Rewards* tab lists all the faction standing rewards you can potentially claim. You are unable to claim rewards if you do not meet the faction standing requirement or the faction's presence in the settlement is too low for the given reward. Note that you can only claim Equipment and Gear rewards once. Effects can be reclaimed if you lose them (due to losing faction standing) but become eligible for them again later on. In this case, any level of the corresponding faction's presence is sufficient.\n\nBy default, you can take on one Task from a given faction but a better Standing allows you to take on more.

The /vagrus/ stood by the often eccentric scholar despite the dangers of the enterprise and even saved her when the ritual awakened the entity residing in those ancient bones.

The selected units add their Combat Strength\Defense to the total but have a chance to be wounded or killed. Workers and Slaves become mortally wounded after a single hit, while other combatants become wounded first. Severely wounded Companions and mortally wounded crew can not fight, while wounded crew grants lower Combat Strength than healthy ones. Check the detailed result of each round by clicking the scroll button. (#4)\n\nIncluding Passengers and\or Arming Slaves (#2) is an option but these have their consequences, like losing Morale and Obedience.

Dark Elf
According to legend, the race today called Moreldin were once Elves, but their ancestors were cast out and exiled after massacring their own kind during a series of tragic events. Shunned and stripped of their immortality, this progenitor clan sought refuge underground and found solace in the perpetual darkness and the embrace of Demonic worship. They hate light and the sun that burned their eyes and revealed them for what they truly were. In the next several thousand years, they conquered the deep places, built their underground great cities, and became a power to be reckoned with. After the Calamity, many of them relocated below Xeryn from their northern realms as it seemed to be both a new frontier and a place that became more hospitable to their needs. Loosely allied with the Empire, many Dark Elves are known to worship Demons, among whom Bal Ur Kaal is chief.\n\nDark Elves look like Elves, but are shorter, with dark grey skin and pale blue eyes. Their hair is white, grey, or silver.

*Factions* are organizations you can cooperate with to gain their favor and with that, rewards and boons. You have a *reputation score* with each faction that defines your standing with them, indicated in the bottom left corner of each faction icon. Tiers range from negative 5 to positive 5 and are shown on the top left of the icons.\n\nBy clicking on a faction icon, you can learn more about them, your standing, and what rewards you can gain from them.

Quick Camp and Automarch can make exploration easier. While they are turned off by default, you can turn them on in the Options menu under *Game Settings*.\n\nToggling *Automarch* on will make it so that when you choose to travel beyond your normal Movement Points (MP) limit, your /comitatus/ will proceed forward and expend March Points automatically. Without this feature on, you will instead automatically stop moving when you run out of MPs.\n\nToggling *Quick Camp* on will give you an additional option from the radial menu when you travel, which allows you to instantly camp, ending the day without the usual camp UI popping up. *Quick Camp* will use all the settings you have locked in from your previous camp.\x20

Renkailon is a Dark Elf and thus is not a common sight in the sun-drenched northern reaches of the Empire as his kind shuns the light in general. However, through his long life as a wanderer, explorer, and scout-for-hire, Ren has learned how to deal with such inconveniences — and much more. He is a capable fellow, even if somewhat of a coward, preferring to skulk in the background and deal with matters in a subtle way. A true veteran of many /comitati/, he has vast experience coordinating scouts and leading the way. Ren is fairly likeable and easy-going — for a Dark Elf — but he seems to be harried by something he does not want to disclose.

They say that ignorance is bliss, and that often, knowing half the truth is more dangerous than not knowing anything at all. Certainly, this can not be truer than in the case of the Leviathan, whose dark origins the /comitatus/ began discovering in the employ of the researcher and rogue mage Kandake. The vagrus stood by the often eccentric scholar despite the dangers of the enterprise but could not save her when her ritual awakened the entity residing in those ancient bones. The spectacular failure of Kandake unleashed an evil into the Riven Realms that caused great peril in the years to follow, but nobody learned who was responsible for the calamity.

Human (Imperial)
Imperials are an industrious and generally cultured people, tracing their origins back to the ancient humans of Daromar who migrated south and settled in the land of Aetruas. The Empire managed to survive the Calamity, albeit at great cost, and remains one of the greatest powers on the continent of Xeryn. At its peak, few - if any - realms could match its prosperity, knowledge, and power, though this came at the cost of slavery and the oppression of other nations. Imperials in the Fourth Age are usually proud of such a past, though it is sometimes fused with a sense of bitterness. Business and progress are also close to the Imperial spirit and the heritage of building a great society still lingers in the post-Calamity era.\n\nImperials are light of skin and often dark of hair, though people of Daromarian heritage tend to be tall and fair haired.

Due to a reputation of being a heartless mercenary and a loner, nobody considered Morwen a valuable asset to a /comitatus/ such as yours. Yet you saw something in her and offered her a job years ago. She accepted and you have never regretted it ever since. A deft scout and a skillful warrior, she has proven her mettle more times than you could recall. She is very quiet and reticent, which is in stark contrast with the aura of uneasiness that surrounds members of her race, the Demonkin. You don't mind that either though, as she mostly keeps to herself.

As an alternative to acquiring supplies when you camp and end the day, you may also acquire supplies during the day.  This can often be useful, as the node you choose to hunt or forage on may have a significant impact on the results.\n\nIn almost all cases, this will cost 2 Movement Points (MP). If you do not have any remaining MP, it will instead cost 1 Vigor. You can send out multiple *Hunting* and *Foraging* expeditions during a day, though these will face diminishing returns depending on the outcome of previous attempts.

Locals keep mentioning an odd Wraith called Vrak who is haunted by ghosts. At least that is what he claims, perhaps to justify his freakish behavior. But who knows, maybe you can help him out? They say he lives in the Hintercaves.

'This /comitatus/ I speak of had fallen under hard times. Perhaps it was due to Imperial harassment or unfortunate decisions; or simply bad luck. Irafons, Saint of Roads, does not always smile on us mere mortals. But however it came to pass, their coin was drying up, and their opportunities seemed few and far between. One of the last chances their /vagrus/ saw was to travel to the remote town of Scrapheap and spend their remaining funds to stock up on cheap scrap metal. This metal could be sold for great profit over in the east and south. It wasn't a bad plan, truly. But it was not without risks, either.'

Deputies are your officers in the comitatus.  On this pane, you can assign your Companions to Deputy roles and check what boons each Deputy provides.\n\nYou can *assign* a Companion to a Deputy role by dragging and dropping their portrait in an available slot (available slots are signified by a coin). Only Companions with a *Deputy Perk* can be assigned.\n\nOne Companion can only fill one role (even if they are eligible to more), and each role can be filled only once. The maximum number of assigned Deputy roles depend on your *Authority* (a Leader characteristic). Assigned Deputies unlock new Equipment slots for the /comitatus/.\n\nThough you can only assign or remove Deputy roles while in camp or resting, you can always consult this pane through the Comitatus Management window or directly from the Leader window.
Assign Morwen #1 to the Scout Master Deputy role. #2 Then close this window.

Your progress is saved at checkpoints. Whenever you leave a *settlement*, reach a story-related *checkpoint*, as well as at the *start of each in-game day*, your game is saved *automatically* (overwriting the previous Autosave save).\n\n*Manual saving* is unavailable in  the standalone story 'Pilgrims of the Wasteland'. In the open-world main campaign, you can save  manually in the game menu (F10, Escape), except during combat and Events.\n\nYou can *load* your saved games from the Load menu (F9 to access directly) or from the main menu.

Here you can see the number of each crew and beast type you have in your /comitatus/. Consult the tooltip for each type to learn more about their role.\n\n*Outriders* are special because you need a Fighter and a Mount to be able to create an Outrider by using the '+' button. While Outriders are excellent fighters, Mounts without riders carry cargo. You can always dismount Fighters using the '-' button.
For now, add an Outrider #1, then close this window by clicking the X (top right corner). #2
